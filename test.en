Asking other peoples or ethnic minorities for forgiveness, acknowledging our past errors and crimes cannot, will not ever diminish the stature of a people or nation; on the contrary, only by doing so can a people or nation become great.
We know full well that the notion of collective guilt has led to universal conflagration and to the extermination and prostration of peoples.
My message is that there is no alternative to a historic Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation either for the Slovak majority, the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, or for relations between Hungary and Slovakia.
Thank you for your attention.
(RO) Mr. President, on 14 September, I submitted a resolution proposal to the Private Office of the President of the European Parliament regarding compliance with the linguistic rights of Romanian communities in Europe and the conservation of the Romanian language in the context of promoting multilingualism and cultural diversity.
At the end of August, an unprecedented testimony was the exchange of opinions with the members of the Ilaşcu group, which took place in the Sub-Commission for Human Rights.
They spoke about the closing down of Romanian language schools and about the fact that books written in the Romanian language are burnt in the Transnistrian region of Moldova.
Also, I have received numerous complaints at my parliamentary office from the Romanian community of Valea Timocului in Serbia, in relation to the prohibition of the right to learn and pray in the Romanian language.
The same things can be said about the Romanian communities in Bulgaria and Ukraine.
In the context of the beginning of 2008, a year of intercultural dialogue and attention given by the European Union to promoting cultural diversity, as well as by creating the position of Commissioner responsible for multilingualism in 2007, I believe we cannot ignore the situation of continuous infringement of the linguistic rights of Romanian communities.
We must promote their protection, both within the foreign policy and the internal policy of the European Union, to find solutions for improving the current situation.
(RO) Mr. President, the European press has presented a series of abuses committed by employers from the European Union Member States against seasonal or permanent workers coming from the newly acceded countries, abuses associated with serious infringements of the labour legislation.
Such regrettable cases are possible due to the fact that the newcomers are not aware of their rights on the labour market, the relevant legislation and, especially, the institutions competent to protect them.
This is the reason why I firmly request the European Union to urgently establish offices, in all Member States, for free legal consulting on labour law for workers coming from other Member States.
I also consider that, for regulating such situations, the Commission also has to take into account measures for encouraging and facilitating the migration of labour forces between Member States.
(PL) Mr President, for us Poles the Gdansk shipyard is not just the birthplace of 'Solidarity', it is also a symbol of the changes that have taken place both on a national and international level.
It is also a symbol of freedom and partnership.
At present there is a conflict between the Board of the shipyard and the European Commission, which is demanding a drastic reduction in the shipyard's capacity and the closure of two slipways, or else the refund of state aid.
I would like to make public here that the Gdansk shipyard was the beneficiary that received the lowest subsidies and despite that was the only one of them to make a profit in the first six months of this year.
If the shipyard were to give in and accept these conditions, then, practically speaking, this would be the end of this symbolic shipyard that has done so much to deserve assistance.
The supervisory board of the shipyard has decided to increase the initial capital by PLN 300 million, which would be allocated for additional investment.
It is still possible to save this shipyard.
I believe that saving this workplace would be an honourable action not just for Poles, but also for the European Union.
Today the workforce and I ask that the Members sign declaration no.
81 concerning the future of the Gdansk shipyard.
In addition, on a formal issue, Mr President, could I say a couple of words since I have the floor?
I would like to ask who gave Mr Schulz the job of censor?
He does this job without politeness, without manners, he interferes in debates and speaks out of turn.
I would also add that he certainly does not have the majority behind him.
(EL) Mr President, we returned last week from Palestine where we in the Committee on Development were fortunate enough to see the current situation both in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
The Gaza Strip has reached crisis point.
What was once an open jail is now the scene of a catastrophe because the Israeli authorities have decided to ban imports.
Hospitals, for instance, have medicines but no spare parts for their equipment.
Roads are piled with rubbish and there is a danger of tanks overflowing with effluent.
In short, the humanitarian situation is desperate.
People in Gaza are living on the breadline; the difference between the two Palestinian territories is beginning to become obvious.
We as a Parliament must therefore take action to free Gaza from its isolation and to bring about a sustainable solution based on the needs of a whole nation rather than those of the inhabitants of one side.
(DE) Mr President, like my colleague and friend Milan Horáček I wanted to address an event that occurred yesterday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was the first German Head of Government to receive the Dalai Lama, in Berlin.
She has stood firm against all the verbal attacks and disparaging personal remarks made by the Chinese.
She has repeated that she is prepared to support the Tibetan people in their aspiration towards cultural and religious identity and desire to achieve genuine autonomy.
Our European Parliament, which is the voice of human rights throughout the world, also endorses the non-violent approach the Dalai Lama has consistently followed.
Let yesterday's event set an example throughout the European Union.
It should encourage our Member State governments never to give in to China, not even under economic and political pressure.
(Applause)
Mr President, my point is simple: as energy becomes the focal point in international politics and as efforts to create a single EU energy market are increasingly resisted by the existing national monopolies, the efforts of the same Union to further integrate the foreign policies of its Member States into a common foreign and security policy would be consequently undermined, because, on the import side, Member States seek to continue to secure preferential deals with the major suppliers and, on the export side, they would attempt to extract maximum gain from unilateral policies.
The effects are already visible: in spite of the hard talk at Union level, the truth is that, instead of reducing its current energy dependency, the EU is becoming more and more dependent on Russian and/or Russian-controlled energy supplies.
Not that a substantive relationship with Russia is a bad thing in itself, but, the more substantive it gets, the more unbalanced it tends to get too.
As a citizen of a country with enough experience in the matter, I know how difficult it is to keep politics away from trying to exploit such an economic dependency.
(SL) Mr President, I have drawn attention on a number of occasions to the Slovenian minorities in Italy and Austria but on this occasion I welcome the Italian Government's actions last year aimed at implementing a law to protect the Slovenian minority, namely the establishment of a list of 32 municipalities in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region and support for the building of a Slovenian school in San Pietro al Natisone and Slavia Veneta.
These measures will ease the lives of the Slovenian minority in Italy and satisfy at least some of their rights and needs.
However, I also call upon the Austrian Government and our fellow Austrian MEPs to do their utmost to ensure that Austria also makes the earliest possible start on implementing in full Article 7 of the Austrian State Treaty.
I refer in particular to paragraph 3 which in principle guarantees the Slovenian minority the right to bilingual signs.
This will promote coexistence and even better relations between the countries concerned and also relations within the European Union.
Mr President, I rise to make a protest and a proposal.
I want to protest against the actions of the Polish Government in blocking a decision in Council to have a Europe-wide declaration regarding the abolition of the death penalty on 10 October 2007.
I believe that delivers a very bad signal to the many countries around the world which persist in retaining the death penalty, some of which execute children and people with mental disabilities.
Something like 5 000 people are executed by states every year and 28 000 people languish on death row, so it is inexcusable that a full Member State of the European Union should in any way deliver an opinion which seeks to undermine the argument for ending the death penalty.
I wish to propose that you undertake an initiative for this Parliament to mark 10 October in a special way, and that you encourage the Member States of the European Union, and all the parliaments of the Member States, to do likewise.
Mr President, I rise on an issue of an animal disease, blue tongue, which has spread through Europe - through France, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium; and now we have one case in the UK.
It is a difficult disease to find and it is a difficult one to diagnose, and the long-term solution is a vaccine.
I recommend to this Parliament, the Commission and the Council that we do everything in our power to get a vaccination in place, because this disease has killed over 1.8 million cattle and sheep in the last 10 years in Europe.
So we need to do something about it seriously.
I would urge you to put all pressure on the Commission, the Council and this Parliament to get a vaccine available.
This item is closed.
Road Map for renewable energy in Europe (debate)
The next item is the report by Britta Thomsen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a Road Map for renewable energy in Europe.
rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the committee members for their excellent and constructive cooperation in connection with the report.
I am pleased that we are now placing renewable energy high on the agenda, as renewable energy will constitute a vital cornerstone for Europe in demonstrating to the rest of the world that we can actually fight climate change and secure energy supplies for our citizens.
I consider my report an opportunity for Parliament to both influence the shaping of impending legislation on renewable energy and at the same time ensure that the Heads of State or Government and the Commission are aware that the ambitious targets that have been adopted require significant and genuine effort if they are not to simply end up as empty promises.
First and foremost, I would like to emphasise that a central message in my report is that we have created the right framework for the development of renewable energy.
It means that we are integrating all our policies within the energy sector.
Renewable energy cannot be seen as separate from the other targets within the energy sector, specifically the implementation of an internal market for electricity, achievement of an energy efficiency potential of 20% and revision of the CO2 emissions trading scheme.
All these targets are interconnected and the primary concern therefore is to ensure that we achieve the proper legislative framework.
We shall compel the Member States to implement already adopted legislation and decisions, and guarantee a long-term perspective that encourages investors to become involved in this huge venture.
These are the preconditions that need to be met so that we can achieve our political objectives of greater security of supply, reduction of CO2 emissions and creation of new jobs in Europe.
Yet, at the same time, we must develop an energy policy that is based on solidarity with the developing countries where more than a million people have no access to energy.
The energy sector must no longer simply be regarded as a technical element in our everyday lives, but more as a joint player in resolving the problems involving the environment, climate and security of supply.
I have highlighted that one obvious example of the need to create integrated policies is the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds.
These funds provide the opportunity for investments in renewable energy, energy savings and other climate-promoting measures.
However, the expenditure plans for the Member States indicate that the new Member States would prefer to use the money to build motorways rather than invest in renewable energy.
Just one percent of the funds has been allocated to renewable energy and energy savings.
Therefore, I would urge the Commission to revise the guidelines to provide systematic support for green energy projects in the EU, so that there is a link between what we adopt, on the one hand, and the way in which we allocate funds, on the other.
In the report, I have also underlined the importance of incorporating energy efficiency within the National Action Plans.
Several people have pointed out to me that their separate action plans for energy efficiency do not belong in this report.
However, I feel that it is precisely the establishment of this link that is fundamental, because otherwise it will be a purely Sisyphean task if we continually increase our energy consumption whilst simultaneously attempting to achieve a relative target of 20% renewable energy.
These two things must and shall be amalgamated.
We must constantly maintain the perspective that investments in renewable energy are an asset to Europe.
The promotion of a market for renewable energy will contribute to the fulfilment of the Lisbon targets by increasing employment within the Member States and by increasing the initiatives of the Member States and the EU with regard to research and innovation.
The final subject that I would like to emphasise today is of course the issue of biofuels and renewable energy in the transport sector.
I would like to encourage us to really move forwards within Parliament and adopt a comprehensive approach towards the transport sector, which also secures political objectives concerning the expansion of public transport and the switch from road to rail and waterborne transport.
Although in general I support the idea that the transport sector must also carry its share of renewable energy, I believe that there are a couple of pitfalls that we need to be aware of.
Firstly, the introduction of biofuels should not result in us slackening the requirements for energy-efficient cars.
We must not allow a message to be sent to the car industry to focus on bio-fuels instead of more efficient cars
Secondly, we must establish requirements concerning sustainability criteria that ensure a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and concerning the view that an increase in demand for biomass can be compatible with the preservation of biodiversity.
Furthermore, a focus on biofuels must not lead to a marked increase in food prices.
Last but not least, we must emphasise that biofuels are not the only way in which renewable energy can be used in the transport sector.
Electric cars are expected to play a greater role in future.
I hope that we will have a good debate today and that collectively Parliament can send a signal to the Commission and the Member States concerning the importance of achieving the EU's targets for renewable energy.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Ms Thomsen on her excellent report.
Renewable energy has always been high on the agenda of the European Parliament, and now Member States are also increasingly aware of the need to strengthen their performance in this field.
Constantly increasing the use of renewable energy resources is one of the main pillars in European policy to achieve sustainable, competitive and secure energy supplies.
Therefore, Ms Thomsen's report will play a crucial role in the formulation of the Commission's proposal for promotion of the use of renewable energy that I intend to present to the College by the end of this year.
I would just remind you that Mr Vidal-Quadras's report played a huge role in the formulation of our package on the internal energy market.
I am pleased to say that my approach in preparing the proposal is already very much in line with most of the calls from Parliament.
I would like to mention that the proposal will be adopted together with the greenhouse gas reduction and emission trading scheme proposals.
We will continue the integrated approach from the January package to ensure consistency between renewable energy and climate change policies, and create synergies between them.
Now I would like to turn to some concrete points of this report to discuss them in more detail.
I share your view that the completion of the internal energy market is a very important issue in our energy policy, and it is indispensable that renewables are rapidly integrated into the internal energy market.
That is one of the reasons why the Commission adopted the third internal market package on Wednesday.
Access to the grids is an essential precondition for the successful integration and expansion of electricity generation from renewable energy sources, as well as objective, transparent and non-discriminatory authorisation procedures.
You rightly pointed out the importance of reaching an agreement soon on assigning a share to each Member State to achieve the 20% binding target for the whole EU in 2020.
As you would expect, the methodology to be applied is quite a politically sensitive issue.
We are currently working on the proposal and the Commission is discussing this topic with Member States.
It is vital that the national targets are established in a fair and transparent way.
But just as important is the establishment of a trading scheme which can give the needed flexibility, and to ensure that this will work in an EU-wide market.
This will also contribute to our goal of producing renewable energy cost effectively.
I agree with you on the importance of creating and implementing national action plans.
National action plans submitted by each Member State and approved by the Commission should contain the national sectoral targets, the development paths in each sector and measures to be taken in order to reach these targets.
The Commission will assess the national action plans based on specific requirements and criteria laid down in a new directive.
I agree that renewable energy sources in the heating and cooling sector have to experience a significant growth, and this has to be ensured by the legislative framework.
The intention is to cover this sector in the directive as well.
Many heating and cooling renewable technologies are highly economical and there is a lot of potential in this area.
I welcome the support of your report on the minimum 10% biofuels binding target.
I agree with you that we have to ensure that biofuels are produced in a sustainable way.
The Commission will include measures on biofuel sustainability in its proposal.
These measures are not aimed at limiting biofuel imports, but the standards would apply equally to domestically produced biofuels and imports as well.
To sum up, the new legislative framework on renewable energy sources should ensure that we reach the EU-wide target of 20% by 2020.
This will require serious investments to be made, a regulatory framework and, most of all, strong political will.
I believe that this report gives us confidence in it.
I would like to come to the last point.
There have been doubts expressed that the Commission intends to let nuclear energy count towards the renewables target.
Can I say clearly that this is not, and never has been, the case.
The 20% target of the renewable energy in the final EU energy consumption will only be met by renewable energy.
Nothing in the internal market package adopted last week, or the forthcoming directive on renewable energy, changes this.
Honourable Members, you have been our strong support in creating a European response to the global energy challenge.
I count also on the support of the European Parliament for the legislative proposal of the Commission.
But I get more and more encouragement coming from Member States.
Today, Gordon Brown, at the Labour Party Conference, said, 'by investing in energy efficiency, renewables, carbon capture, clean fuels and new environmental technologies, I want Britain to lead in carbon-free vehicles, carbon-free homes and carbon-free industry.
And I want the new green technologies of the future to be the source of British jobs in British businesses.'
The only difference is that I want it to happen in the whole of Europe.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mrs Thomsen for her report as well as Commissioner Piebalgs, because I believe that an alliance between Parliament and the Commission can genuinely be achieved.
In that respect, I consider that Parliament has already made a fundamental contribution to promoting renewable energies, with a vision of the future and of the use of renewable energies to tackle the major problems that lie before us.
There has to be general consensus on such an important endeavour and our starting point has to be a gradual approach, because I believe that a systemic policy is needed if we are to apply the various renewable energies to the system as a whole.
Firstly, I should like to stress that biomass was also discussed in depth in the Environment Committee as well as the importance of a gradual approach, especially as regards the use of agricultural forest residues and urban solid waste, because their exploitation offers considerable advantages, without tilting the balance between energy, food and raw material uses.
For that reason, what is before us is an extremely important task and not an impossible challenge.
There has to be general progress in the system as well, and I am referring here in particular to heating, cogeneration and trigeneration so that the energy content of resources can be fully exploited.
We also need an overall policy underpins and gives priority to electricity supplies generated from renewable sources, so that incentives can also be provided for the conversion of biomass into gas, paving the way for much greater rationalisation and efficiency.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me thank Mrs Thomsen for her balanced report.
I would like briefly to outline the key points of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's opinion.
Our committee expressly welcomes the proposed Roadmap for Renewable Energy as an important contribution to the sustainable development of Europe.
We need to make more efforts to develop renewable energy sources.
On the one hand, Europe has to safeguard its energy supply and reduce its dependence on foreign imports.
On the other hand, we must observe our commitments to climate protection.
In the energy mix of the future, bio-energy will also have a key role to play in boosting rural employment and the rural economy in Europe.
At the same time, the promotion of bio-energy must not lead to distortions of competition.
The set-aside rules no longer fit into the system and should be abolished, partly also because of the shortage of agricultural land as a result of the competition between food production and renewable raw materials.
In its opinion on Mr Lang's report on an EU biomass and biofuels strategy, our committee already attached special importance to the introduction of an EU certification system.
On the one hand, we must avoid putting additional administrative burdens on our own producers by applying existing regulations, such as the one on cross compliance.
On the other hand, biofuels imported from third countries should also be certified according to strict environmental criteria, in order to ensure a positive environmental balance.
When we promote biofuels we must not allocate the available resources primarily to research into second-generation biofuels.
There is still a considerable need for research into first-generation biofuels.
Adequate attention should also be paid in research and development programmes to decentralised means of producing biofuels because of their many advantages.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) The European Council of March 2007 adopted an agreement that the European Union should generate part of its total energy mix from renewable energy sources.
Tomorrow the European Parliament will be voting on the corresponding report, in which we give our support to the proposals of the Council and Commission for future legislation on the matter.
I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen, on a magnificent report based on wide-ranging discussions with all parties.
The report calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for renewable energy framework legislation and emphasises the importance of creating and implementing Renewables Action Plans at Community and national levels.
Those plans must promote investment, innovation and research in all sectors relating to clean, low-emission energy sources.
For that we need more investment in research, development and innovation to ensure that renewable resources achieve a level of competitiveness similar to that of conventional energy.
We in the EPP-ED Group do not advocate binding targets; we believe compulsion, as well as the setting of sectoral targets for renewable energy resources, should be subject to subsidiarity.
What we do advocate is calling for ever greater efforts from the Member States in regard to research, support, reducing red tape and simplifying authorisation procedures, so as to facilitate the development of renewable energy sources.
And, in defence of the internal market, we believe that an effective and efficient harmonised support scheme should be the long-term objective in Europe in order to ensure the most efficient use of renewable energy technologies.
We call on the Commission to make sure that any framework directive on renewable energy includes measures to promote heating and cooling by means of renewable energy, which are the least developed technologies so far.
We also welcome the Commission's proposal to promote biofuels and other renewable energy sources in the transport sector, and we call on the Commission and the Member States to step up efforts to develop second-generation biofuels so as to avoid the many tensions arising from the shortage of raw materials.
That shortage cannot be blamed on the development of biofuels: there are a number of factors at work, including the common agricultural policy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague Britta Thomsen for this report.
It once again raises the energy debate at European level.
Our energy industry is affected not only by outsiders, but also by our own mistakes.
These should not be forgotten.
We have, for example, allowed our spare capacity to fall by around 1% every year, and that is creating insecurity.
I want to draw your attention first of all to the position regarding electricity produced from renewable forms of energy.
Mrs Thomsen and I have drafted an amendment to her report on this very subject.
It is important that there is proper support for electricity produced from renewable sources of energy.
Renewable energy should also be a means of relieving fuel poverty.
The industrialised countries must develop techniques and methods to help ensure that poor nations can rely on a supply of energy.
Now economic poverty, information poverty and energy poverty are all hitting the same people.
Meanwhile, in Europe, there cannot be a viable single energy market as long as most of the Member States fail to adhere to jointly-made agreements.
It has therefore turned out that solidarity in the EU looks likely to lack solidarity.
It is always awkward setting targets for energy production and use, and it has to be based on reliable science.
Sector-specific targets for renewable energy at national level therefore need to be established with careful consideration.
The circumstances relating to energy vary enormously.
We should, for example, discuss with the Member States monitoring schemes, classifications of biofuels for transport and the status of nuclear energy, when calculating targets for renewable energy.
Nuclear power, as an emission-free form of energy, should not raise the target for renewable energy.
The Commission has classified peat as a fossil fuel, although the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has moved it into a category of its own, somewhere between fossil fuels and biofuels.
Now we have obtained new and positive results from research into peat's effect on climate, with reference to the lifecycle model.
When a bog is exploited first for peat production and then either for afforestation or the cultivation of reed canary grass, it has less of an effect on climate.
At present in the Emissions Trading Scheme peat has an emission factor of 106, whilst with coal it is only 94.6, because the calculations have not taken account of the entire lifecycle of peat use.
This should be put right quickly, Commissioner.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, may I thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done on this report.
Renewables have been part of the energy mix in Europe and part of European energy policy for a number of years and this report very usefully highlights why they have not yet expanded to their full potential.
One of the problems has been access to the grid.
We have a distribution network for electricity which was designed to be one-way and now requires technical adjustments in order to become two-way and be able to handle decentralised electricity generation.
Member States should be doing more to get rid of the technical and administrative barriers currently hampering the expansion of renewable electricity.
The biggest potential from renewables exists at the two ends of the scale.
On the one hand, we need a new commitment and investment in large-scale renewable energy projects such as offshore wind farms in northern Europe, solar collectors around the Mediterranean and tidal barriers.
At the same time, at the other end of the scale, we need to maximise use of renewables at a domestic level - technology such as solar thermal, photovoltaic panels, heat pumps and biomass heating.
I particularly welcome paragraph 38, which stresses the need for compulsory use of renewable technologies in all new and renovated buildings.
It is time for a major revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, not least because the renewables roadmap needs to be considered hand in hand with the EU's action plan on energy efficiency.
The binding target of 20% EU energy from renewables by 2020 is much more likely to be met if we succeed in cutting total EU energy consumption.
The way to cut carbon emissions is to have renewables as an increasing element of a decreasing energy requirement.
On the question of biofuels, I would emphasise the absolute necessity for all biofuels, whether imported or produced in Europe, to satisfy sustainability criteria in respect of net CO2 savings, biodiversity protection, water resources and effects on food production.
But I think we should accept the Commissioner's reassurances and continue to support the 10% biofuels target.
In December, though, we will need to look very carefully at the Commission's proposals to make sure that they meet the strict sustainability criteria Parliament is demanding.
Finally, this roadmap for renewable energy should not just be a roadmap for Europe.
By supporting investment in renewable energy technology in the developing world, we can achieve two crucial objectives.
First, much-needed growth can be achieved without the cost to the planet of increased carbon emissions and, secondly, developing countries can achieve, through renewables, a degree of energy independence and energy security.
They can be sheltered from the fossil fuel price shocks which have ruined so many developing economies in the past.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, speaking on behalf of the UEN Group in this debate concerning renewable energy in Europe, I would like to thank Mrs Thomsen for preparing a complex report on this subject.
First of all, the author of the report is right to say that the most important issue, also as regards the future of renewable energy in Europe, is to develop a common European energy policy.
Unfortunately there does not appear to be any progress in this area, even though there have been some ill-defined promises about including this policy in the EU Reform Treaty.
It is almost two years since Poland, which has already experienced the consequences of differing energy policy interests among individual Member States, for example with regard to the construction of the Russo-German Baltic gas pipeline, presented guiding principles for the creation of such a common energy policy at a meeting of the Council of the European Union.
Unfortunately, at that time this proposal did not attract any interest, as it ran counter to the interests of the most important EU country, i.e. Germany.
I would like to express the hope that this time the European Commission will approach the task of preparing a common energy policy more seriously.
Secondly, in order to allow producers of various types of renewable energy better access to the distribution network in different countries, it is vital to separate distribution grid operators from energy producers.
If we do not do this, then electricity producers using traditional sources that are also either the owners or controllers of transmission grids, will not want to make them available to those who produce energy from renewable sources.
The final proposals from the European Commission in this regard met with vigorous opposition from powerful energy interests, principally from France and Germany.
It will be interesting for us Members of the European Parliament to see how the European Commission deals with this opposition.
Thirdly, the strategic objectives for renewable energy, namely the generation of 20% of total energy from renewable sources and achieving a 20% energy efficiency improvement by 2020, are deserving of attention and support.
I would like to express the hope that, in order to achieve these ambitious objectives, the European Commission will propose introducing appropriate support instruments not just at EU level, but also in Member States.
I would like to draw particular attention to the production of bio fuels, which not only increase the amount of renewable energy used, but also mean that agricultural resources are not used only for the production of food, and in this way reduce overproduction.
By the same token I do not agree with the argument of the report's author that the production of bio fuels could result in an increase in food prices and that it will therefore be necessary to open the EU market to food coming from third countries.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the future is already upon us.
The time for renewable energy sources has come, and only a boom in renewable energy, together with much greater energy efficiency, can help us cope with the climate change crisis and the energy supply crisis.
I am grateful for this excellent report.
We can map out a medium- and long-term road for promoting renewable energy and motivating the reticent, of whom, I see, there are still a considerable number.
The report emphatically demands that the Commission produce framework legislation for the promotion of heating and air conditioning by means of renewable energy.
It calls for a level playing field for renewable resources on the energy market and a reinforced emission trading scheme, with internalisation of the costs of polluting energy sources and removal of the massive, perverse subsidies for fossil fuels.
It seeks to promote offshore wind energy, takes a firm stand on high-temperature solar energy, and calls for more funding for research into the storage of renewables and the adaptation of national grids.
Finally, it asks the Commission to draw up an action plan in favour of bio-construction, given that 40% of all EU energy is used in buildings.
And now we come to a point of conflict.
The debate on biofuels raises a moral issue and a question of principle: to eat or to drive?
If we approve a binding target of 10% for biofuels in this report, we must be aware that we are fuelling a conflict between 800 million car drivers, on the one hand, and 2 000 million of the poorest people on earth, who are competing for the same grain.
The euphoria engendered by biofuels risks endangering the food supply of Europe and the world.
And we do not even know whether the energy balance is positive.
Given rising oil prices, it is becoming cheaper by the day to burn cereals rather than make bread or feed dairy cows.
We must therefore proceed with great caution and not adopt binding targets, which have, moreover, already been called into question by major international institutions and many scientists.
We cannot allow the remedy to be worse than the disease.
On this crucial issue we must trust to good sense and apply the precautionary principle.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, according to a forecast by the International Energy Agency, oil will become an extremely scarce natural resource in five years' time.
Natural gas will be even scarcer by the end of the decade.
Today 80% of the EU's energy is produced using fossil fuels, mainly oil and gas.
That is why the Commission's proposal for a directive on increasing the use of renewable energy resources is necessary.
Renewables today account for a little over 6% of the energy consumed in the EU.
Of that, biomass and the incineration of waste account for 4.2%, hydroelectric power for 1.5%, wind power for 0.3%, geothermal energy for 0.3%, and sunlight for hardly anything.
The aim to raise the share of renewable energy resources to 20%, in other words triple it, by 2020 seems way too ambitious.
On the other hand, the European Parliament had previously decided to ask for still more: 25% by 2020 and as much as 50% by 2040.
The Commission's proposal for 20% refers to an EU average.
Only Latvia, Sweden, Finland and Austria exceed that target today, but these countries do not escape the directive: instead, higher targets are being set for them.
The EU's biggest countries bring up the rear, with the United Kingdom at 2%, Germany 4%, Poland 5% and France, Spain and Italy 6%.
If the 20% target set in the directive is to be achieved it will depend on how willing and able the big Member States' are to increase the use of renewable energy.
It would be interesting to know how they will do it.
If they simply pay lip service to the directive, the Commission will have no way of forcing them into it.
They may, however, be forced by circumstances outside the EU as a consequence of rising prices for oil and gas and as a result of our disposable lifestyle.
Mr President, the Thomsen report rightly advocates a vigorous approach to ensuring that renewable sources make up a major proportion of our total energy use.
Fossil fuels are after all finite and the use of renewables reduces the amount of greenhouse gases generated.
It also creates the diversification we need in order to reduce our dependence on just one or two energy sources.
I am fully behind the rapporteur when she says that biofuels must be used in a responsible way only.
The EU must work towards international agreements which will ensure that sustainability criteria can be applied to biofuels within the context of the WTO.
It matters very much what kind of biofuel we use, how it is grown and how it is used.
Biofuels are only sustainable if the whole cycle from producer to user has the lowest possible impact on the environment.
This means that biomass must be not only produced sustainably but also burned sustainably.
In production, that means that crops must be replanted after harvesting.
In combustion it means, for example, that the emission standard must be just as strict as for other fuels.
More extensive strategic choices are also required in the face of undesirable effects like the depletion of virgin forest and the competing imperative of food supply.
In poor countries, especially, biomass production puts pressure on agricultural land and pushes up food prices.
What specific policy measures does the Commission envisage to eliminate these undesirable effects?
Lastly, the rapporteur wants proper account to be taken of the differing circumstances of the Member States.
But one Member State has a greater potential for exploiting solar energy, whilst another is more likely to be able to harness wind energy.
So a harmonised system, of the kind which the report envisages for the longer term, is no obvious matter.
A system of support is most effective when it is geared to those energy sources with the greatest potential and that, Mr President, differs from one Member State to the next.
Mr President, may I first commend Ms Thomsen on the work and commitment that she has put into this report.
Mr President, you will not mind me reminding you that we come from a party that thinks 'green' but votes 'blue', and that leads me to a general statement that we are all in favour of renewables as a general principle.
However, we support realistic, achievable renewables, not expensive subsidies for unattainable targets.
And it has to be said that this year the Commission and the Council have set some very ambitious targets.
I want to reflect a little on the dilemma posed by large-scale hydro or tidal schemes, or a massive shift into biomass energy crops, because each has advantages, but each also has environmental implications and costs.
For example, in the region I represent, the Severn Tidal Power proposal has huge potential for electricity generation but an equally huge cost.
The last estimate was EUR 20 billion, which is quite a lot to anybody.
That cost is justified, however, partly by CO2 emissions saved and partly by flood damage prevented, and the value of the electricity generated is only a small part.
Then we have to consider the huge environmental impact of such a scheme on the Bristol Channel and its associated features such as the Severn tidal bore, a special feature, and the surrounding wetlands.
So it seems to me that there is a dilemma, a conflict between the two interests, and the same applies to converting a lot of land to produce miscanthus or other energy crops.
We must be realistic about legislating for binding targets which cannot or will not be met.
We in the European Union have a long record of adopting admirable targets and then failing to achieve them.
If we continue in this vein, we risk bringing the legislative process into disrepute.
If we adopt regulations requiring changes in people's behaviour, then it seems to me we must will the means, either by providing enough time for change or by fiscal incentives in combination with a regulatory stick.
Finally, let us not forget the huge potential of energy efficiency; but that is for another debate.
Mr Chichester, I think you failed to hear when the Commissioner quoted extensively from Gordon Brown's speech to the Labour Party Conference today or else you were otherwise occupied, but we were very much fascinated by this intervention.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, warm thanks to the rapporteur, Britta Thomsen.
It is a good report.
I hope it will be adopted on Wednesday by as clear a majority as in committee, for in spite of the somewhat critical remarks by Mr Chichester we achieved a broad, almost unanimous majority in favour of the report in committee.
As I said, it is a good report, and it is also an important and necessary one.
You know that the Commission is currently preparing a framework directive to implement the spring Summit decisions on achieving a target of 20% of renewables by the year 2020.
The Commissioner has spoken to you about it and it was good to hear him say clearly that the Thomsen report will play a relevant role.
What is the issue now and what is really important?
Firstly, we have successful directives, especially on electricity but also on biofuels.
So the important thing now is to take up and to strengthen and improve those successful directives, as pointed out in the Thomsen report.
Secondly, we must commit ourselves to what the Commissioner already agreed in plenary last year, which is to include the area of heating and cooling, in order to minimise the deficits we have in that sector and improve market penetration.
Hitherto we have taken a clear sectoral approach, and I believe we must not forgo this.
It is also extremely important to ensure that the national action plans include really clear sectoral targets, binding targets, to ensure that here too we have a broadly-based development of the various technologies.
It is most important to decide how the 20% are to be assigned among the Member States.
That really means we must ensure a fair distribution of burdens, or rather opportunities, a distribution that really is based only on potential and on what has already been achieved, what already exists in the countries concerned.
So we really must take a very clear approach here.
I am glad that the report states very clearly that we are concerned here only with renewables and not with low-CO2 energy sources.
May I thank Commissioner Piebalgs once again for making that clear.
I believe the Commissioner has a major responsibility here.
We have seen a genuine new impetus, with the presentation of the electricity directive.
I hope the same will happen after the framework directive, which, I hope, we can expect before the end of this year.
Mr President, Churchill once said that the best way to make a task seem difficult is to postpone it, and I think that is one way of describing the energy debate we are having in Europe today.
In answering Mr Chichester, who says he thinks 'green' and votes 'blue' - well, what is left, maybe, is to act 'green' as well.
The proposal from the Commission and the decisions we have in place on 20% of the total energy consumption in Europe by 2020 being derived from renewable sources is, indeed, very good.
It is also nice for everyone - for all voters, industry and citizens in Europe - to see that Parliament, thanks to Ms Thomsen's work on this report, is also very decided that this is a good way to work and that this is the way we should do it.
Is it possible?
There are question marks, of course, when people ask questions.
I think it is perfectly possible.
If we look at what can be done in industry by trigeneration and by using renewables, it is perfectly possible.
In households, on heating and cooling, it is also perfectly possible, and in the transport sector also.
I am very happy that, in combination with what we have here on renewables, other regulations in place in Europe are changed.
It is about time we put more ethanol in petrol, and with the new decisions we will at least have half the rate that Brazil has.
I think it is about time that we discussed whether we put biogas and natural gas as well, which is the best way of boosting the volumes we need.
When we do that, we also have the market in place and then the development goes on by itself, step by step.
There are some responsibilities, of course.
The renewable action plan - both at European level and national levels - has to be good and come into force quickly.
The second area I want to point out is taxes.
I cannot understand why we tax people out of behaviour that we want them to have when it comes to fuels of different kinds.
The third thing is regulation, where we can still do a lot and where we have to do some cleaning also in the European system.
Finally, I think we are in the midst of an engineering revolution that has the same consequences as when we went from steam to electricity, and now we are going from electricity to smart energy, and this is a very good step on the way.
(PL) Mr President, the road map for renewable energy is an important document, thanks to which it will be possible to obtain renewable energy.
The continuing increase in the prices of oil and gas could be helpful for the achievement of the objectives listed.
The European Union has only about 2% of the world's gas and oil resources.
Its economy is and will be dependent on the price of raw materials as well as political stability in oil-producing regions.
For this reason the objective of 20% of energy from renewable sources seems unsatisfactory.
The European Union should follow a diversification policy as regards the production of electricity, which should take into account the different possibilities of creating renewable energy in various countries and regions.
Local and regional action plans need to be created for the production of renewable energy and for energy saving, and these should be supported by local government, national governments and the European Union.
Research programmes relating to energy production should be given priority.
Also, where necessary, the possibility of developing nuclear power, which reduces CO2 emissions, should also be taken into consideration.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen for a very far-reaching report.
(DE) Mr President, let me begin by warmly congratulating Mrs Thomsen on her very good and comprehensive report.
This report, which I hope will be adopted by a large majority, follows the tradition of this House of urging the Council and the Commission to promote renewables.
Let me briefly address the central issue that will come up in the next few weeks when the Commission presents its draft directive.
The key question is security of investment.
We need investment if we are to reach the 20% target.
We must look at when and where investment has proved successful over the past six or eight years.
There are two systems in Europe: the system of guaranteed input prices and the system of green certificates.
A total of 90% of all renewable energies apart from large-scale hydropower were produced under the system of guaranteed input prices.
They were produced more cheaply than under the system of green certificates and, most importantly, this made it possible to introduce new players into the electricity market.
Those figures all come from the Commission's last report dating from December 2006.
I am rather shocked by what I am hearing now.
There is information that a majority in the Commission will probably be in favour of abolishing this good system and introducing a trading system with green certificates.
I must seriously warn the Commissioner against adopting that strategy, which would benefit only major, dominant energy firms such as E.ON, RWE, EDF and others, because it would lead to investment uncertainty and make other players reluctant to invest in future.
You will be judged on whether there is local investment, which should be on the basis of a comprehensively guaranteed security and not the kind of haphazard mechanism of green certificates.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that Europe must work harder on developing renewable energy resources, whether because other resources are diminishing rapidly or because in the whole energy mix renewable energy sources represent an important tool for lowering emissions.
I deliberately mentioned the whole energy mix since I consider it to be the fundamental factor in this matter.
In my opinion, when developing renewable energy resources, and especially when laying down the rules for such development, we have to think carefully about how to proceed.
Our aim is not to reach the target percentage level of renewable resources but to lower emissions and decrease dependability on other resources.
Therefore, we must not forget about the energy mix.
As the practical application of other worthy and ambitious goals and declarations has demonstrated, including here in the European Parliament, we achieve nothing by simply setting percentage quotas without taking into account the geographical, economic and other conditions that are typical of individual countries or regions.
We must proceed carefully so that we remain competitive in comparison to other countries.
We also have to remember that some renewable energy sources, for example solar or wind energy, require considerable financial resources.
Therefore, it is 'yes' to renewable sources but 'no' to a militant attack without factual debate and arguments.
Indeed, energy from renewable sources is still not cheap; many countries or consumers simply cannot afford it.
(DE) Mr President, in March 2007 the European Council, headed by our Chancellor Angela Merkel, decided that 20% of total energy consumption should come from renewables by the year 2020.
The advantages are self-evident: lower CO2 emissions, less dependence on energy imports from unstable states, growth and employment opportunities, especially in rural areas.
Following the summit decision, we now have to implement those objectives.
The following points are particularly important here.
The Commission must have the necessary powers and resources to be able to ensure that the individual Member States actually comply with the objectives set at the summit.
If we want to achieve a target of 20% of total energy consumption being made up of renewables, then every Member State must play its part.
At the same time, as provided in paragraph 9 of the report, each Member State must be free to choose the most appropriate renewable energy source in the various sectors.
Another key issue is improving energy efficiency.
We can only achieve the 20% renewables target if we improve energy efficiency as a whole.
There is an enormous untapped potential in the area of building insulation and energy-saving electrical appliances, where there are many innovative technologies that could already be marketed.
We must also do more than before to introduce renewables in the heating and cooling sector, given that 40% of total energy used in the EU is used in buildings.
There is a huge potential here for the use of renewables.
Modern structural planning and energy-saving new buildings can help ensure that renewables cover the entire energy demand for buildings.
Biomass is another source of renewable energy, which must be further developed because of its versatility and base load capacity.
We must ensure, however, that biomass production is sustainable and does not compete with food production.
Here, as stated in paragraph 57 of the report, we must ensure that biomass is managed according to internationally recognised high standards of sustainability.
It must also be ensured that overall the development of biomass has a positive effect on the climate and energy.
It is also important to note the contribution of nuclear energy to climate protection.
At present, we cannot do without nuclear energy as a low-emission technology.
A high priority must also be given to research into renewable energy sources in the EU.
Technological developments in this area are decisive to sustainable energy supplies.
In particular, we must further encourage and promote the development of storing renewable energy sources, for example on the basis of hydrogen technology.
All in all, I eagerly await the Commission's proposals at the end of this year.
I hope the Commission will take many of Parliament's requests on board.
(ES) First of all, let me thank the rapporteur for her thorough and serious work.
Once again Mrs Thomsen has proved extremely knowledgeable on this topic.
The report presents an analysis of the situation that is both correct and balanced.
Fossil fuels are running out; they come from politically unstable parts of the world and continue to be a major source of CO2 emissions.
Moreover, our energy needs are growing all the time.
To meet those needs and achieve a secure supply, we have to find new massive energy sources that are non-polluting and decrease our dependency on the outside world.
In this context, advances in renewable energies are particularly relevant.
Thanks to investment in research, European Union firms in this sector enjoy a leading position on the world market and contribute in large measure to job creation and greater competitiveness - two major objectives of our Lisbon Strategy.
The situation with regard to renewable energies varies considerably from one Member State to another, and so do the - mostly inadequate - political and legal frameworks in each country.
Nevertheless, the limited existing legislation has proved effective in stimulating more sustainable development in many of the Member States, despite the fact that in such important areas as heating and cooling, there is still no legislation at all.
If we are to move forward, it is crucial that the framework legislation proposed by the Commission should be ambitious.
It must improve and strengthen the existing regulations and set binding targets for electricity generation, transport, heating and cooling.
It is also imperative that the Member States put those agreements into practice without delay.
To meet the binding 20% target it is also essential, as the report very rightly stresses, that electricity generated from renewable sources should have better conditions of access to the grid.
We need open, non-discriminatory and effective access for renewable energy to grids that are sufficiently developed to cope with large quantities of electricity from renewable energy sources.
I agree with the rapporteur that separation of ownership of the transmission system operator from commercial activities is the best guarantee that there will be no discrimination against renewable energy producers in terms of access to the grid.
The implementation of projects of European interest for trans-European energy networks must also be speeded up.
The recent appointment of coordinators for projects encountering technical, political or financial difficulties is a step in the right direction.
Finally, both the Commission and the Member States must continue to promote investment, innovation and research in these sectors.
And they must make all necessary efforts to ensure that energy from renewable sources is produced at accessible prices.
Achievement of the targets set in the framework legislation must not impose a burden on consumers and firms because of an exhorbitant increase in energy costs.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate Ms Thomsen on her excellent report.
I also wish to congratulate the four draftspersons of the opinion who offered useful additional points and advice.
Even to the most difficult-to-convince-people, and that probably includes Mr Chichester, who has now left, it is now clear that our planet is warming up dangerously and that climate change is a real threat to life on earth as we know it.
How much of this change is due to natural climatic variation and how much is due to the accumulation of climatic change gases in our atmosphere is still a matter of some dispute, among scientists and politicians.
Where there is no dispute is that the accumulation of gases such as CO2 is certainly making climatic change worse, much worse, and even at this late stage, when the catastrophic effects of climate change have commenced, the world is awakening slowly, perhaps too slowly, to the urgent need to do something about it.
The EU is one of the frontrunners in trying to deal with this problem.
The road map for renewable energy in Europe is certainly an important step in the right direction and I am sure it will have the full support of most MEPs, but once a proper legislative framework is achieved, Member States must be compelled to implement it and effective monitoring systems must be put in place.
In order to have a real effect in halting gas-induced climate change, two further goals must be achieved.
Firstly, a road map for renewable energy must extend further than the EU to cover as much of the world as possible.
This is a formidable task, indeed.
Secondly, we must understand that we must make our citizens themselves understand that, along with action and renewable energies, we need to reduce energy spending in general.
If we go on increasing our energy needs indiscriminately and seemingly in a limitless fashion, then, irrespective of how many road maps on renewable energy we draw up, all will be ineffective in the end.
(FR) Mr President, if we mean to tackle global warming and to translate this ambitious road map into practice, it is absolutely essential that we make the link between energy and environment.
Of course, we have warned repeatedly that the Member States will not achieve the target of a 12% share for renewable energy by 2010.
So how can we expect them to achieve 20% by 2020?
The Commission's method of development calculation fails to take into account the environmental costs of energy production and we continue to produce energy policies piecemeal, whereas what we need is an integrated, comprehensive approach.
Energy is an area of policy where we are capable of doing much better and achieving rapid results.
For example, energy efficiency needs to be promoted so that all of us can eliminate unnecessary spending on energy.
Administrative procedures also need to be simplified.
In France, for instance, you have to complete a bureaucratic obstacle course in order to fit a solar panel: no fewer than seven separate procedures are involved in turning an energy consumer into an energy producer.
However, what we do must also be consistent with cooperation for development.
What are the Union's proposals for developing renewable energy sources under the partnership agreements with the ACP countries?
When we talk of solar power, for example, the poorest nations tell us that they simply cannot afford the technology.
And what about those Member States that finance the cultivation of biofuels in countries in the South?
In Africa and Asia, jatropha plantations are springing up even in regions where drought is a problem and where the demands of food security are pressing.
Not only that, but the Union bears responsibilities towards the third countries that supply our raw materials for energy production.
European investment in Niger's uranium mines or in the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline must be accompanied by transfers of technology for clean energy production based on microprojects.
The energy crisis, Mr President, is an environmental crisis; it calls for emergency plans and binding policy measures.
We need to pull out all the stops on renewable energy.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, as we speak the Kyoto targets are being discussed in Washington and I believe the UN is right to discuss these global targets and to set targets as part of a top-down strategy, as well as creating the necessary instruments.
We believe it is important for us to concentrate on the bottom-up strategy, namely the Lisbon Agenda, and we should seek to ensure that employment and growth are achieved mainly through energy efficiency targets.
We have new objectives for various trades here.
We can produce a real economic impetus and a win-win situation through insulation and many other energy-improvement measures.
I believe that in terms also of security of supply it is important to focus on renewables.
Renewable energy, which is growing in our latitudes, is a secure source that is available to us at all times.
We should ensure that we really do achieve the target of renewables accounting for 20% of our final energy consumption by the year 2020.
We need EU-wide criteria for support measures, for incentives, for subsidies, for taxes, for the whole financial framework that we need to set up here.
That is a challenge and I think it is one that Commissioner Kovács also faces.
Secondly, we need transparent and fair network access.
We need the 'must-carry principle' and we should consider penal charges for non-transport in this case.
We need harmonised planning procedures with a one-stop mechanism under which authorisation procedures can be concluded within a given period, i.e. a maximum of three years, to ensure that energy production is available at the right time.
We also need to safeguard the consumers' right to order 100% of renewables from their suppliers and therefore to have secure energy supplies for decades to come.
Nuclear energy is not a renewable energy, which is why I would ask for it to be dealt with in a separate report.
(NL) Mr President, Mrs Thomsen has delivered an outstanding report on renewable energy and I wholeheartedly endorse her commitment and the stated target of 25%.
Combating climate change is an enormous challenge, but it offers great opportunities too.
Opportunities for new technologies and clean and renewable energy.
In addition to established sources such as wind turbines and solar panels, we shall probably also have energy sources such as high-altitude wind power from one kilometre up, sun reflectors, tidal power, wave energy, geothermal energy and algae fuel technology.
It is an exciting trend and I welcome it.
Investing in renewables brings more advantages than merely reducing CO2.
It reduces our dependence on non-EU countries, it breaks the power monopoly of the energy giants and it leads not only to huge innovation but also to more new jobs, about a million of them.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is of course all very well, but it also needs good policy.
There are three points of importance here.
Firstly, the need for decoupling.
Total decoupling is an absolute priority if renewable energy is to develop rapidly.
At the moment it can take a long time for a wind turbine park to be hooked up to an electricity grid and that is unacceptable.
I hope the proposals which the European Commission has put forward this week can be made a little more robust, that we can resist the pressure of the energy monopolies and ensure that the proposals do not get watered down.
Secondly, there are biofuels.
We have good ones and bad ones.
At present everyone seems to be focusing on the bad ones.
With good reason, because there are grounds for questioning the usefulness of some biofuels which bring hardly any environmental benefit.
Some biofuels are very detrimental to biodiversity and to food prices.
But under strictly controlled conditions biofuels can help towards a more sustainable system of energy supply, subject to guarantees that tropical rainforests will not be felled in order to fill up our cars.
I agree with the paragraph in Britta's report which says that clear criteria must apply to this 10% level of biofuels in the energy mix.
In my report on the Fuel Quality Directive I put forward proposals on this and I look forward to hearing your reactions.
Lastly, the matter of subsidies.
Regrettably, subsidies are still given for the production of fossil-based energy.
Over the last 10 years the European coal sector has received about 50 000 million euros in product-related aid.
Aviation fuel is free of duty, a hidden subsidy.
The inclination is now to give generous subsidies to renewable energy.
That is not the right thing to do.
We must end the subsidising of fossil fuels as soon as possible.
Instead of giving subsidies we must compel energy producers to draw a substantial part of their production from renewable sources.
Then there will be no need for subsidies.
We must be careful not to replace our addiction to oil with a new addiction to subsidies.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me thank the rapporteur for presenting this report.
I believe it is important in this context to point out that we must look at energy policy in terms of a number of different objectives.
How can we ensure security of supplies, how can we ensure it does not harm the environment, and how can we also get it at a good price?
If we take account of those three factors in each of these debates, we will realise quite soon that renewables naturally play a part, probably an important part, in the future shape of energy, but that this sector alone cannot resolve the problem of energy supplies in terms of price formation, environmental impact or security of supplies.
That is why it is important to ask the questions that have already been put clearly by various speakers today, for instance to look at the question of how and where we can use renewable energy in the most economically intelligent manner, as we do for other resources.
We must consider where we can put the euro to the most effective use, which means we must not, for instance, promote solar energy in an area where conditions are not at all conducive to its use.
We must consider whether decisions and percentages, whether binding targets will really bring us forward or whether it would not be more sensible to do a little more to promote subsidiarity and to support initiatives that go in very different directions in different sectors depending on the Member State concerned, while leading to a comparable objective.
At the same time we must identify the drawbacks that also exist in the case of renewables.
We have already had debates about biofuels.
Six months ago the subject never even came up.
We have debated wind power and the damage it can cause.
In my country we have problems with finding enough space to develop wind power.
That does not mean saying no to these renewables, but it does mean a differentiated debate and a differentiated response, for in the end a sensible energy policy must not raise false expectations it cannot fulfil but must raise expectations that it can then fulfil step by step.
I thank the Commission for its very open and differentiated approach.
(FI) Mr President, we cannot cut carbon dioxide emissions in line with our targets unless we employ the twin strategies of energy efficiency and renewable energies.
There are at present big differences between the different Member States as far as the use of renewables is concerned.
We need binding country-specific energy efficiency targets and targets for renewable energies.
The rapporteur is absolutely right when she focuses attention on two very practical matters with regard to how we achieve these targets within the European Union.
We must insist that the Member States with large populations and which at present produce a very small part of their energy using renewable energy sources should close this gap.
The efforts made on the part of the small countries will not be enough on their own to solve the problem.
The other important observation, something which has been raised here, is that we have to exploit natural phenomena. We have sunshine; we have the potential of biofuels; and in some places we have wind.
These phenomena need to be taken into consideration in national programmes.
It is crucially important that the policies pursued by the Member States should be sustained and consistent.
Only in this way will we get investors and sponsors, as well as industry, involved.
Unless the support systems and regulation are on the right track, allowing us to achieve a sustainable energy policy, we will not accomplish the real revolution which has been called for in energy policy here.
Regarding biofuels, we need to speak in favour of second generation biofuels and not as if we were promoting competition between food and fuel.
(ES) Mr President, the decision of the Heads of State and Government to approve a binding target of 20% for renewable energy sources in our energy mix for 2020 has had a great impact throughout the world and constitutes a milestone in Community policies on climate change and energy use.
Tomorrow Parliament will be voting on the corresponding report, in which we express our support for the proposals of the Council and Commission for future legislation in this field.
As co-legislators, we are under an obligation to develop viable economic policies that meet society's real needs, always bearing in mind the available technological framework.
The target of deriving 20% of our energy mix from renewable sources will be economically viable only if two conditions are met: the price of a barrel of oil remains high and the price of a tonne of CO2 is suitably dissuasive.
The Commission's impact studies are based on a price of around 20 euros for a tonne of CO2.
The current price fluctuates by 12 to 15 cents.
With these figures the cost-benefit calculations are not as attractive as we would wish, and this must be taken into account in the next revision of the emissions trading scheme if we want to send industry and consumers the right signals.
There can be no doubt that the diversification of clean energy sources must continue to be the main priority in energy policy.
Thanks to the Council's courageous action in March, the time has come for Member States to negotiate the distribution of burdens and obligations.
In conclusion, Mr President, I therefore call on the Council to ensure that distribution takes place quickly on the basis of a solid compromise in which no party feels itself a winner or loser.
(HU) I congratulate Mrs Thomsen on her excellent report.
I agree with my fellow Members, and in particular with my colleague Mr Paasilinna, that we cannot be doctrinaire in matters relating to energy and that we must not think of renewable energy as a panacea in itself.
It will not solve Europe's problems on its own, but it is a very important step in the right direction.
In this regard we are all in agreement, and this point is masterfully underlined in Mrs Thomsen's report.
At the same time, however, several Members have made the point that technological progress is needed, because the new Members States and poorer Member States in particular perceive the use of solar power, wind power or - in the case of my country, where thermal springs abound - geothermal energy, to be extremely expensive.
I would ask Commissioner Piebalgs to urge the Commission to consider carefully how these technologies might be stimulated in Europe, perhaps also by means of tenders.
I do not mean simple technologies of the kind my fellow MEPs and I saw recently in Tibet when we were told that households were equipped with solar power.
We were reluctant to believe it, but it later transpired that they were referring to a very simple little plate capable of heating a jug of water in half an hour.
I am thinking of altogether more serious technologies.
As regards the agricultural sector, biofuels are very important, and I agree with Mrs Myller that we must not create a situation that pits biofuel production against the food industry and food production.
Let us also be sensible about bioethanol production, because sometimes producing bioethanol consumes more fossil fuel than it enables us to save.
I believe, therefore, that we need to take a diversified approach on this issue.
(SL) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, renewable sources of energy meet two major challenges: firstly, the challenge of securing a reliable supply of energy, in that they provide diversity and reduce reliance on imports and, secondly, the challenge of climate change, in that they do not cause direct releases of greenhouse gases.
Renewable sources of energy have been popular in Europe for some time.
Renewables are a subject which scores political points.
Their importance to further social development is advocated by us politicians, economists, scientists and power engineers, and also by home-owners who are not normally involved professionally in the fields of power generation or environmental protection.
However, the proportion of renewable sources in the overall energy mix is increasing only slowly.
Why is that?
Perhaps we politicians are not engaged enough?
I do not believe that is the case since the field of renewables accounts for the majority of European legislation relating to energy.
However, I do believe that in establishing an appropriate framework we have emphasised the technical and supervisory aspects and neglected the economic aspect and an overall assessment.
I believe that we should not deal with renewable sources in isolation.
We must assess their advantages and weaknesses alongside other sources of energy.
We must consider their contribution to the diversity of the energy mix, to the reliable supply of energy, to the reduction in releases of greenhouse gases and to the formation of a knowledge-based society.
We must assess the extra research and development needed.
We must carry out a macro-economic assessment to build on our earlier technical approach.
An important factor in deciding on investment is the financial cost of releasing one tonne less of carbon into the atmosphere, for example.
Until we carry out an appropriate comparative cost analysis to build on our conventional approach to policy-making, we will not achieve the desired results in our energy and environmental policies.
However, if we do, if we do carry out an overall analysis, the barriers between the various sources of energy will be removed since only a heterogeneous, lasting energy mix will be important.
(ES) Mr President, almost everyone agrees that we in the European Union are facing three basic challenges: the first is the exhaustion and rising price of conventional energy sources; the second is the need to reduce our growing dependence on energy imports; and the third is to help hold back climate change.
Clearly, renewable energy sources can make a major contribution to meeting these challenges.
We now have a commitment to achieve 20% of total energy generation from renewable sources by 2020.
Obviously, Member States are free to choose the renewable energy sources that best suit their own situations.
But they must commit themselves - there must be an unambiguous political commitment - to meet the targets we have jointly set ourselves.
I would like to stress four points.
First, renewable energies are not incompatible with other energy sources that can help stabilise supply, but they must be the preferred option.
Other energy sources, such as nuclear power, should not be discarded, but the persistent problems of waste management and high construction costs have yet to be solved.
The use of biofuels, however, requires great caution and should be based on criteria of sustainability.
It could otherwise give rise to serious environmental damage and have adverse social consequences.
On the other hand, there are great possibilities for developing the use of renewable energies in the construction of new housing and infrastructure.
Finally, there is the social dimension of energy policy: the introduction of renewable energy sources must not give rise to price increases that put heating or electricity beyond the reach of consumers, especially the most vulnerable sections of society, which are especially hard hit by rising energy prices.
Mr President, I think it is actually quite fun to have a lively audience.
We do not always get applause and cheers and shouts.
I know it is forbidden, but I think it is actually quite fun, so it should be allowed.
If you would allow me, I would like to make three points.
The first one is actually an echo of what the Commissioner said.
I think that we need a common energy policy.
It is very important, of course, that we look at the national targets, but as an overall approach we must look at it from a common perspective.
This means that we need to revise a lot of the legislation in the pipeline and we need to focus, as Mr Paasilinna said earlier, on a proper energy mix while looking at the whole programme.
My second observation is about fair burden-sharing and I am quite happy with the 2020 aims in this respect: they are good and they are ambitious.
I am not 100% sure that we will ever achieve them, especially on the renewables side, but nevertheless it is a good aim.
But, in doing this, it is very important that we have a careful look at the burden-sharing.
I do not want to be in a situation whereby small states such as Finland, which already has 25% renewables today, have to hike up their burden to, say, 45%, whereas the five biggest Member States, which actually consume 60% of energy, keep much lower standards.
So let us be really fair on this.
On top of that, of course, a country like Finland is not going to have too much solar energy, unfortunately.
The third observation I have is about the methodology for calculation.
It seems that wind and solar are penalised in relation to biomass.
Fine, let us try to live with it but look at it very closely.
With the national action plans, I would like to hope that the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport has enough staff, or is able to recruit enough staff, to deal with, monitor and implement the issues.
In my remaining time, these are my three points: firstly, we need a common energy policy, secondly we need fair burden-sharing and, thirdly, we need to be very careful with the methodology for calculation.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Thomsen on her excellent report.
Considering the challenges posed by climate change, our high dependency on fossil fuels and the growing challenge of creating rural jobs, the European Union needs a clear, easy-to-follow regulatory system enabling it to operate effectively as regards renewable energy production, and especially as regards biomass production.
We need to create the kind of legal environment for producers that clearly sets out activities and operating frameworks relating to renewable energies.
There is little point in our having directives to increase the share of renewable energy if the appropriate conditions are lacking; those concerned will not want to risk starting up this new kind of production.
We cannot allow a situation to arise where we mislead farmers by encouraging them at European Union level to produce the raw materials for bioenergy production, while in some countries the regulatory framework at national level does not provide an optimal environment for doing so.
A long-term, well thought-out programme is needed, because otherwise producers will see this new type of production as too big a gamble.
We must guarantee security of production, but we cannot expect consumers to pay the higher retail prices.
Producers need incentives, and in some cases tax allowances will need to be provided to ensure that the transition does not entail operating difficulties for them.
We must provide appropriate incentives to ensure that biofuel production will not bring about a rise in food prices, because this would undermine the whole programme.
Thank you for your attention.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to focus in on two areas of Mrs Thomsen's excellent report, namely the building industry and motor cars.
If we are to meet the targets for CO2 in the automotive sector we have to invest more in research and development.
That much is obvious.
Our review of the multiannual budget gives us an opportunity to do that, Commissioner.
The research effort on new technology and renewable energies for transport needs to be stepped up dramatically.
It should be one of the priorities for our brand-new European Institute of Technology too.
Europe's automotive sector can give a lead here, ladies and gentlemen.
Some Japanese car makers are now advertising the manufacture of 'zero emission' vehicles as their goal.
I think that we in the European Union are well capable of being the first in the world to make that goal a reality.
Then there is that other sector that is crying out for new environmental technology: construction.
This need has been highlighted time and again.
It is the sector which the European Commission itself describes as the one with the greatest potential for reducing CO2.
Construction of new, low-energy housing, 'passive housing', is still in its infancy and still relatively expensive.
Here too, it is high time we moved up a gear, not only on research and development, but also on tax incentives.
We could perfectly well lower the rate of VAT on energy-saving materials and renewables in construction still further, perhaps even to zero.
The European Commission in any case has plans - you know this better than I, Commissioner - to put forward new proposals for lowering VAT by 2009, and they could ideally include these ideas for energy-saving measures in the construction sector.
So major challenges await us in the months and years ahead.
And they require bold and resolute action.
(LT) The thorough report by my colleague Mrs Thomsen will help us live in a cleaner environment and resist climate change.
Ambitious action plans on renewable energy at European and national level as well as monitoring of their implementation will be included in the Common European Energy Policy and reduce dependency on energy supplies from third countries.
However, some countries have significant water, solar or wind energy potential, while other countries have less potential.
Therefore, action plans for different countries should be drawn up individually, with everything calculated on a real basis.
It would be useful if the European Commission were to direct support from the structural funds towards the production of renewable energy as well as the insulation and heating of residential blocks.
The use of renewable energy should also be promoted in fiscal policy.
In Europe, we face a rise in food prices related to the increasing demands of biofuel.
That cannot be.
What can an ordinary EU citizen living from salary to salary say if the need to increase the use of renewable energy sources cause higher electricity and housing prices?
The market cannot regulate everything.
It is necessary to provide assistance for those in financial difficulty, especially those who are suffering the most from rising energy prices.
Generally speaking, I am sure that we will have to change our lifestyle and limit our extravagant consumption in the future.
Human beings have harmed the planet and it is therefore our responsibility to help it recover.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, energy supplies are becoming an increasingly serious challenge, not just for the European Union but worldwide.
In that context the use of renewable energy sources is crucial, both to ensure security of supplies in future and to make a decisive contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We must support and promote innovation.
We must also invest more in research and development of new technologies, whether in the field of transport - e.g. research into new fuels or the construction of new engines - or in the field of the thermal or energy-based use of resources such as heating, electricity production, insulating materials and so on.
One good example is combined electricity-heat production from biomass by power-heat coupling, which is also being used increasingly in Austria.
Another key aspect is energy saving.
Regional, decentralised concepts are also of crucial importance.
We must use the opportunity offered by the decentralised production of energy and biofuels from renewables because it can also produce sustainable energy and use raw materials that are available on the ground.
The use of agricultural products to produce energy will certainly not prevent the production of adequate food supplies, since enough productive farmland is available and that land can also be used adequately.
The suspension of set-aside in the 2008 financial year is, therefore, really welcome.
Furthermore, the use of renewable raw materials can contribute substantially to the economic development of rural areas because of its positive impact not only on land use during normal crop rotation but also, in particular, on employment and the creation of new jobs in rural areas.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent job she has done.
We must bear in mind that the ambitious goals to which the European Union has committed itself, aimed at reducing emissions of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect, increasing the use of renewable sources of energy and enhancing energy efficiency, can only be achieved if we implement them in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, beginning with social and economic actors at local and regional level.
Decentralised energy policy, hand in hand with research programmes and campaigns aimed at changing consumer habits, could bring tangible results not only in terms of use of renewable energy sources but also in terms of employment and regional development.
Local production, and possibly conversion and consumption, of renewable energy sources create new jobs, while regional economic stability is increased by diversifying energy supply and making it efficient.
I would like to emphasise the paramount role of financial incentives both as regards connecting renewable energy sources into existing networks and getting renewable energies onto the market.
It is in the fundamental interests of local authorities and regional organisations (the President interrupted the speaker, requesting him to speak a little more slowly) to support enterprises' activities in the field of innovation and research and development.
By supporting partnerships between the public and private sectors, the European Union could help public and private-sector players in society to join together to provide an economic shot in the arm for regions whose development they would like to stimulate.
In order for this to be successful, it is vital for local businesses to be informed about development opportunities and to assess the characteristics and specific needs of the region concerned.
I recommend that the European Union should monitor closely Member States' compliance with what is expected of them, as regional and local initiatives will be unable to flourish unless Member States put in place frameworks of their own that are compatible with EU legislation.
Member States have an obligation to create a legal environment that not only enables increased energy efficiency and use of renewable energy, but also provides every possible economic support and incentive to foster local and regional development initiatives.
(LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the targets put forward in Europe's energy strategy is to increase the proportion of total energy consumption accounted for by renewable energy resources to 20% by 2020.
Latvia is a leader in this sphere, since the proportion of renewable energy in Latvia is already 37%. When allocating targets for the proportion of renewable energy to each Member State it is difficult to do so fairly, and to ensure that each Member State is actively involved in making use of renewable energy.
I can support the rapporteur's position, that we must take care that the larger Member States do not obtain reductions and targets for renewable energy proportions that are lower than 20%.
In view of the fact that the five largest Member States account for at least 60% of EU energy consumption, reductions for the large states would entail a disproportionately large burden on the other states.
It must be acknowledged that the EU has already had negative experiences on a similar issue.
The approach taken by the European Commission when allocating CO2 emissions quotas was, at the very least, strange.
According to the Commission's own information the aim of the emissions trading scheme is to help the Member States to meet their Kyoto commitments.
The new Member States are meeting their Kyoto commitments, but their emissions quotas are being significantly reduced.
For example, Latvia, which has the lowest CO2 emissions quota per inhabitant in the European Union, will receive only 55% of the emissions quota it requested.
Estonia and Lithuania will receive 52 and 53% respectively.
The quotas for other new Member States have also been significantly reduced.
In contrast, almost all the older Member States, which are not fulfilling their collective Kyoto commitments, have been allocated more than 90% of the emissions quota requested.
It is not surprising that five new Member States were forced to challenge this decision in the courts.
I welcome the position taken by the rapporteur on the allocation of additional EU budget resources for achieving the targets of the European energy strategy, establishing this field as a priority and revising the EU Financial Framework for 2007-2013.
The targets put forward in the European energy strategy are to be welcomed from both an economic and an ecological viewpoint.
It only remains to appeal to the European Commission not to repeat past mistakes and to allocate these targets fairly, ensuring that each Member State is actively involved in the achievement of the targets.
Thank you for your attention.
(HU) Mr President, I must first of all point out how regrettable it is that the EU's earlier target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the EU's energy mix to 12% by 2010 will in all likelihood not be met.
Despite this fiasco, at the spring summit in 2007 the German Presidency set Member States the even more ambitious goal of increasing the contribution of renewable energy to 20% by 2020.
I believe we need to speak candidly: I fear that the current target, like its predecessors, is also in danger.
It is in danger, moreover, of being sabotaged by the Member States.
For this reason, I strongly urge the Commission and the Member States to reach an agreement as soon as possible regarding the practical implementation of the 20% target for renewable energies.
Member States have already had to submit and prepare their renewable energy strategy, taking into account cost-effectiveness and a sectoral analysis of the potential in each country.
For this reason, the targets set in the Renewable Energy Road Map need to be followed by detailed implementation plans with defined national targets and binding sub-targets for each energy sector, as well as sanctions should the targets not be met.
We need sanctions because countries resistant to implementing the common targets are, let us not forget, jeopardising international confidence in Europe's commitment and reliability as regards combating climate change.
With the chance of achieving global agreement hanging in the balance as it is, this could put paid to it completely.
Europe has a historical obligation and must demonstrate by its own example that there is life beyond fossil fuels, that competitive technology exists and that secure self-sufficiency is possible.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to comment on two points in Mrs Thomsen's report.
Right at the start the report states that: a) 'conventional energy resources are about to run out'; b) 'we are experiencing an increasing dependency on imports' of raw energy materials; and c) 'climatic changes ... will have dreadful consequences for the inhabitants'.
The first point I want to make is that the increasing dependency of EU countries on imports of raw energy materials is the only unambiguous fact, about which there is no doubt.
This is indeed a serious political problem.
However, it cannot be solved by giving unilateral preference to so-called renewable energy resources.
The solution must be far more complex.
That is why I want to stress some aspects that are, in my opinion, missing from the report in question.
Firstly, the individual Member States are responsible for their own energy policy and the corresponding right to have their own energy mix.
Secondly, there is nothing in the report to emphasise that economical spending of the limited funds at our disposal is a necessity, and I stress the word 'economical' when talking about spending such funds.
I also consider it necessary for the European Union to cooperate with the US, including coordination of their policies towards countries that export raw energy materials.
Finally, the report makes no mention of the importance of nuclear energy.
My second point is that the predictions on which the report is based, i.e. that conventional energy resources will soon be exhausted and that climate change will have a dreadful impact on the human race, are debatable.
We should not treat them as incontrovertible facts.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 25 September 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (SK) The present situation regarding power generation and climate change is giving rise not only to positive solutions but also to rushed decisions, which may ultimately have many adverse effects.
What I have in mind is renewable sources of energy that essentially provide new solutions to supplementing diminishing conventional sources of energy and reducing the volume of harmful emissions.
On the other hand, we are witnessing and even taking joint decisions on their ill-considered and rushed introduction by setting excessive binding targets to be attained at all costs.
It is no coincidence that an OECD study and warnings by many experts point out that the ill-considered promotion of certain renewable sources (such as biofuel, biomass, etc.) is causing irreparable damage in other areas, such as agriculture and water management, thus disturbing the overall balance of nature.
It reminds me of the shooting of sparrows in China during what was known as the 'Cultural Revolution'.
By that I do not mean that I am against renewable sources of energy.
However, it is necessary to use those that exist naturally in well-considered areas of use and in capacities that allow them to renew naturally without any effort to increase production artificially in a headlong attempt to attain binding targets as quickly as possible.
Current knowledge and technical solutions enable us, and will long continue to permit us, to use renewable sources only as a supplement.
Therefore, let us look for solutions that will be more reasonable and effective in the medium term.
Nuclear energy is a good example.
in writing. - Finland is one of the world's leading countries in utilising renewable energy sources, especially bioenergy.
The share of renewable energy in Finland is ca. 25%.
The objectives concerning the use of renewable energy sources must be realistic.
In the fight against the climate change, the availability of reasonable priced bio mass, vital for our forest industry, must be ensured.
In Finland peat has been defined as slowly renewing biomass fuel.
As indigenous fuel, peat has a considerable effect on regional policy, and it increases employment and the security of energy supply.
No emission-free, low-emission or other form of generation that is emission-neutral, sustainable and cost-efficient can be ruled out, including nuclear power.
All forms of energy must be assessed on the basis of the overall interests of society.
The share of carbonless energy sources, including nuclear energy, should be increased in the fight against climate change.
Nuclear power increases independence from imported energy, is environmentally cleaner than other options and an economical energy source.
I therefore find it very important that Member States are free to choose the most appropriate renewable energy sources given the differences in geological, hydrological and climatic conditions in the Member States.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, if we are to promote renewable energy sources we have to be precise about what need we are aiming to meet by using them.
It is one thing to be a trailblazer, whatever the price, achieving one's targets and percentages, and quite another to find multi-sectorally sustainable energy solutions that have far-reaching consequences.
It is already clear that the target percentages set and the EU's environmental and climate targets are, unfortunately, incompatible in terms of their achievement.
Despite that, we have decided to try to meet the targets, with the result that we have an energy market which is artificially manipulated at the consumers' expense and energy solutions which are unsustainable in terms of climate balance and which need to be revised.
Compliance with a minimum binding target of 10% for biofuels used in transport would be an unfortunate example of this.
If this is about the fight against climate change, then switching to biofuels will not be the answer.
It can hardly be the right way to go in a world where a food shortage is a likely scenario, given the greenhouse gas phenomenon.
The concern expressed in a study published by the OECD that state subsidies for biofuels could lead to a rise in the price of food and damage to forests is a genuine one, considering that their contribution to the prevention of climate change may be smaller than predicted.
The same concern is raised in an article in the journal 'Science', where the benefit of biofuels to climate is compared with afforestation over a 30-year period.
The findings vary depending on the raw material and production technology, but in all cases afforestation in a given area of cultivation would absorb two to nine times more carbon than the reduction in emissions achieved by using biofuels.
What we need now is common sense when it comes to meeting targets.
Otherwise we will soon realise that the decision sharply to raise the share of renewable energy sources to one fifth of energy production was a hasty one and one that will one day be a threat to the environment through the overfelling of forests.
in writing. - (DE) Renewables must play a significant role in our future energy policy.
Nuclear energy must not play a part in this scenario because unresolved safety problems still remain.
Renewables are our future.
For that we need innovation and the development of new technologies.
We need far more investment in research so that we can bring innovative solutions in all areas onto the market.
In March the European Council agreed to cover 20% of the EU's total energy demand through renewables by the year 2020.
In so doing, the Heads of State and Government took an important step and spoke out clearly in favour of giving more support to renewable energy sources.
That is why I call on the Commission to submit a forward-looking proposal for a legal framework for renewables.
It is crucial for us to have the appropriate instruments available at European level in order to achieve the Council's targets rapidly and efficiently.
in writing. - (RO) Today, the EU depends 57% on gas importation and 82% on oil imports.
It is estimated that, by 2030, the EU will depend 84% on gas imports and over 93% on oil imports.
The EU needs an energy policy that would allow economic and social development, but would also ensure environmental protection by efficient actions against climate changes.
I consider the next 5 years crucial for the planning and approval of "Projects of European Interest” for TEN-E, to diversify energy supply sources and increase energy efficiency at a Community level.
In order to limit climate changes, the EU has planned for the renewable energy resources to provide 20% of the European energy consumption by 2020.
Thus, both the Member States and the Commission must do an inventory of the renewable energy resources on their territory and define action plans for their efficient use.
We request the Commission to get actively involved in this inventory.
Structural funds and the European fund for competitiveness and innovation, as well as the Research Framework Programme 7 can and must be used by the Member States for investments in energy technology.
Development of the Community's railways - Certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community - Rail passengers' rights and obligations (debate)
The next item is a joint debate on
the report by Georg Jarzembowski on behalf of the European Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways and Directive 2001/14/EEC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure (PE-CONS 3635/2007 - -, and
the report by Gilles Savary on behalf of the European Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community (PE-CONS 3636/2007 - - and
the report by Dirk Sterckx on behalf of the European Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on rail passengers' rights and obligations (PE-CONS 3637/2007 - -.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we can all be satisfied with the overall result of the railways package.
As rapporteur on the progress of Community legislation on the development of the railways I may not be particularly happy, but when we look at the results we have achieved in regard to passenger rights, in particular compensation payments for train delays and the Europe-wide certification of train drivers, we can on the whole be satisfied.
I want to start by discussing my own report.
The good news is that as of 1 January 2010 the national rail networks must be opened up for use by all railway undertakings providing international passenger services, without any discrimination, whether the undertakings are public or private.
That will finally create a European single market in cross-border passenger transport and open the way to more offers by a wide variety of railway undertakings, to the benefit of the customers.
We expect the railway undertakings actually to make use of these new opportunities and to make customer-friendly and competitive offers, in relation particularly to air travel costs.
If that proves successful, we have a chance to revitalise cross-border rail transport.
And this is where in a sense I am following on from the previous debate, for we will then also have an opportunity to reduce environmental pollution within the European Union.
One unsatisfactory result of the conciliation procedure is that because of the strong resistance by the Council it did not prove possible also to open up the national railway networks for national railway services, which means that the European internal market for railway services remains incomplete.
To be honest, however, the reason for that lies in the vote we ourselves held in this Parliament on 18 January this year.
The majority of Members voted in favour of the opening up of networks for national rail services too, but we did not reach the required qualified majority of 393 votes on that Thursday.
Nonetheless, in the conciliation procedure Parliament did manage to ensure that the new directive requires the European Commission to submit a report by 31 December 2012 in which it also proposes measures for further opening up the passenger rail market.
For the record, I would ask Vice-President Barrot to repeat his commitment to submit a report by 31 December 2012 and also to take further steps to open up the rail market.
Parliament and the Council also reached agreement that we should certainly restrict the opening up of networks for cross-border services if that jeopardised the economic equilibrium of public and regional passenger services.
That must not, however, lead to some form of protectionism, to a railway trying to protect itself from competition; restriction is possible only if a national government authority confirms, on the basis of an objective economic analysis, that opening up would jeopardise regional passenger services.
Unfortunately a further restriction slipped in during the procedure, which is that Member States may impose a levy for the benefit of public passenger and local services.
Parliament did, in fact, succeed in limiting the levy so that revenue from it must not be greater than is really necessary for the performance of the public service.
I honestly hope that - aside from one country, and even then I hope that will not be the case - Member States will in fact never make use of the possibility of restricting the opening up of the networks.
At any rate, I hope Member States will implement this directive without delay and that we will be able to offer more international passenger services here in Europe and give our citizens a chance to use rail rather than air transport when crossing borders.
I would now like to say a few words on behalf of my colleague Elisabeth Jeggle.
Unfortunately, she is absent due to illness.
First, Mrs Jeggle wanted to thank Mr Savary for the close cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs in relation to the third rail package and say that she is also very pleased with the results as regards the certification of train drivers.
We have managed after all to ensure that there will be a uniform European train driver's licence, for there is no point in opening up the networks if trains have to stop at borders to change drivers.
We want a European internal market.
We want European freight trains - here the networks have already been opened up - and now also international passenger trains to be able to operate regardless of national borders, because we want efficient rail services.
In that regard, the introduction of a European train driver's licence is of key importance.
Here we really can be satisfied with our legislation.
I would point out, however, that it is a question not just of train drivers but of all those entrusted with safety in rail transport.
As you know, just as a plane cannot take off if there are not enough stewardesses because they are responsible for passenger safety in the event of an emergency, similarly we need conductors and other individuals on trains.
We are not talking about the chef in the restaurant car but about railway personnel such as conductors and others who are responsible for passenger safety.
Here we and the rapporteur have jointly managed to persuade the Commission to undertake to submit a report, two and a half years after the directive enters into force, on the possibility of introducing uniform European certification of those employees too, to ensure that we do not have any safety deficit in this area of international rail services either.
Train drivers and other personnel must be properly trained.
We are glad that this train driver's licence also represents a step towards train drivers' mobility, for drivers who hold a European licence can also change their place of employment within the European Union as they please.
We are being fair, however, which is why we jointly ensured that if a person who was trained in one railway undertaking voluntarily moves to another one, the training undertaking is entitled to compensation for the training costs.
I may say, on behalf of Mrs Jeggle, that we are very pleased with the outcome.
There was good cooperation and she asks the House to approve the package as a whole.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, allow me to say at the outset that I share the general satisfaction with this Railway Package.
We have come a long way.
We had four texts when we set out and we have ended up with three.
We started work in 2004 and here we are now in September 2007.
In other words, we certainly took the slow train rather than the TGV.
It has been a long journey but we are now at the end of the line.
We have made it, I believe, thanks first and foremost to the considerable determination of the Members of this House and the fact that they pulled together: I refer particularly to all the parliamentary groups and to the three rapporteurs, who are with us today, but credit also goes to everyone, including the shadow rapporteurs, who did his or her bit.
We are also indebted to the European Commission, and I should like to thank Commissioner Barrot and his colleagues for their cooperation at difficult stages, because the conciliation procedure was extremely tricky and the odds appeared to be against us.
We are indebted, too, to the German Presidency and to the German Federal Minister for Transport, Mr Tiefensee, who invested considerable personal effort: he participated in a number of conciliation meetings and I believe that without his determination to succeed we should not have this Railway Package before us today.
I am thinking in particular of the most problematic text, namely the proposal on passengers' rights.
In that regard, I would also pay tribute to the work done by Dirk Sterckx.
The degree of resistance to rail passengers' rights is a somewhat curious thing.
It is true that railways are different from roads inasmuch as they are subject to remote control.
It is also true that delays can sometimes have a knock-on effect; it is true that security has to come first and that trains may be delayed for quite respectable reasons.
Nonetheless, we are lagging decades behind air transport in this respect, and the obstacle we encountered was the tremendous conservatism of the European railway world: its tremendous resistance to passengers' rights - which was in the end overcome because we agreed to derogations that may leave us looking at implementation in 15 years' time, around 2023.
So, while we may be proud of this text, we have less to shout about with regard to the timetable: it is not really good enough, in my opinion, to introduce passengers' rights over a possible 15-year timescale if our aim - and it is our aim today - is to develop rail travel.
I must say that I am also personally pleased by the introduction of a European rail driver's licence - for that is what is meant by 'certification of train drivers'.
It is a somewhat complex matter.
Georg Jarzembowki outlined the details pretty well, and I believe that what we have before us reflects excellent work by the Members of this House on all sides.
I am grateful to Mr Jarzembowki's group, which does not always take such an open approach on these matters but which, in this case, was particularly supportive.
I should like to think that what has been achieved sets a good example because it came out of dialogue between both sides of the industry in question.
It is, in effect, an example that can be held up to anyone doubting the capacity of the European Union to be a Union of its citizens.
I think it deserves to be publicised.
Let me say, too, that I attach great importance to the commitment we have made - a commitment obtained by the European Parliament - concerning train staff responsible for security tasks.
These people are not train drivers but they nonetheless save lives because, on board trains, it is their job to do so and it is very important that there should be a system of certification for them, even if it will naturally be at a different level from driver certification.
I hope, therefore, that the clause incorporating that commitment, which we succeeded in having included, will be honoured.
Lastly, with regard to opening up and liberalising rail networks, I believe that if we are serious about creating a Europe-wide rail culture, we have to begin by accepting that other people's trains will run across our territory.
That prospect is unavoidable.
For my own part, I advocate a staged approach.
Not all of us will achieve the same level of readiness and, moreover, even when we have our impressive directives in place, there will be entire countries that will still not open their networks.
I am thinking here of Ireland because it has no international lines, and possibly also of Finland because it is, to some extent, the end of the line and would be more inclined - quite legitimately - to open its network to Russia; and I am thinking particularly of all the countries that have different load gauges and different track gauges.
In other words, the big challenge and the first challenge, when we talk of creating a Europe-wide rail culture, is interoperability, and that is where we need to focus our efforts over the coming years.
This Europe-wide rail culture will of course require directives about liberalisation but we need to begin by investing in the networks to make technical interoperability feasible.
Opening the market to competition between France and Spain will mean little, because so long as we keep different track gauges we will not increase either freight or passenger traffic.
The report on certification of train drivers can be seen, in some respects, as a report on interoperability.
What is required is social interoperability that will allow drivers from different countries to think of themselves as Europeans, rather than nationals of a particular state.
It is my belief that if we can move beyond national cultures on the railways, then we shall be able to ensure that the railways have a future.
As road traffic and air traffic continue to grow, that is an urgent task.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that mine was the most complicated of the three reports and that, as Mr Savary says, this was the hardest knot to unpick.
All in all I think we reached an honourable compromise in our discussions with the Council.
I should like to thank all those involved, more especially the shadow rapporteurs, Messrs El Khadraoui, Rack, Zîle, and others, together with the Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, who in my view conducted the negotiations most skilfully, and of course the German Presidency too, as Mr Savary already said; I think Mr Tiefensee and his people put in a lot of hard work on this and were most persuasive in the Council; thanks are also due to the Commission people, the Commissioners and their departments, because I think we had a lot of help from that quarter too.
What did we achieve?
An honourable compromise, as I said just now.
I think Parliament has made sure of a few important things here.
First, we have basic rights for all rail passengers, something that was not at all our goal at the outset.
These basic rights are: guaranteed personal security, liability of the railway undertaking in respect of its passengers, luggage, the services it provides, insurance; it also means that disabled people have the right to travel, without discrimination.
I think we have secured something very important for all rail passengers here: the guarantee of personal safety for all rail passengers.
These are guarantees that the railway companies are obliged to give everyone from the end of 2009.
The second important point, to my mind, is that we have made a difference where it mattered, not between international and national traffic, but between long-distance and local traffic, in other words on the basis of objective data within a single European market we have said, look here, for these passengers you have to do these particular things, and for others we can't; so we are making a different distinction from the one between national and international.
I think that is not insignificant.
For long-distance travel we have secured a system of compensation and assistance in the event of delays, which also covers people who regularly suffer delays, for example commuters and season ticket holders; we have assistance for the disabled at stations and on board trains, certainly on long-distance services and hopefully for all passengers as soon as possible; we have got provisions on the handling of complaints included in the directive.
We have distinguished between urban, suburban and regional traffic, allowing for exemptions, but only when these have been defined by Member States and on condition that they are subject to scrutiny by the Commission.
I think it is not unimportant for Member States to be able to say look here, we distinguish between regional routes on the basis of our own criteria.
We have set out one or two very specific rules here.
That, I think, is what the European Parliament has achieved.
I began by doing my best to convince the Commission to abandon its original distinction between international and national and we then managed to persuade the Council to do likewise.
The first was easier than the second, I have to say.
We met with a lot of resistance in the Council but we managed to steer quite a lot of things in the direction we wanted.
But we have had to agree to the process being slower than we had actually wanted, for example the provision that allows a five-year exemption for long-distance services which may be extended twice more.
But again, that exemption will only be allowed if Member States and railway companies can justify it to the European Commission.
It is important, not only that an exception is allowed, but that it has to be justified.
All in all I think we shall have made significant progress by the end of 2009.
Basic rights.
We are starting a debate which railway undertakings and regulators in the Member States, cannot dodge any longer.
They have to make a start, they must at last start talking to passengers, rail users, about what their rights are and how they are going to guarantee those rights; and I appreciate that it will be a very protracted debate.
For a number of reasons railway undertakings are not always the fastest of operators, in some cases not just because of their history and corporate culture, but also because we are talking serious investment here, and that takes time.
My view was that Parliament had to take account of that too.
In any event, railway undertakings and Member States can now no longer avoid talking about quality improvements and better customer service.
I think the third package generally is a welcome step towards a European rail market.
An open market, a dynamic market, in which different players compete for clients, which means they have to look after their clients too.
My report on passengers' rights is a contribution to this, I think; Parliament's position has been that on principle all rail users are objectively to be regarded as equal.
I think Gilles Savary's report on train driver certification is an important step forward.
In an open market you need that kind of thing to ensure that trains can operate anywhere and that borders are no longer an obstacle.
It is a pity that we did not do what we should have done in connection with Georg Jarzembowski's report and market access. That we continue to differentiate between international and national and are not doing the same for domestic rail services as we are doing for international transport, namely opening up the market and giving players in the relevant infrastructure as much of a chance as possible.
I think Parliament has rather missed the boat there, or should I say the train.
We all know why that was.
I do not know if we would have succeeded in the Council, but it is a shame we did not go all the way with this, as the British put it so nicely.
I think Parliament has done what it could, Mr President; we pushed the Council hard to move forward, as far forward as possible.
Would we have liked to achieve more?
Of course we would, but I hope the majority of the House will accept that Parliament needed above all to get a decision taken here, that we have exhausted all our opportunities in conciliation and that we have achieved some progress on the European rail market which is important both for the travelling public and for the economy of the Union.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 19 and 20 June 2007, following long and tough negotiations, particularly on the question of passengers' rights, the conciliation committee finally reached agreement.
Clearly, the agreement reflected effort on the part of all the institutions, but the European Parliament did contribute significantly in moving this third Railway Package forward.
So I should like to thank Mr Vidal-Quadras, who led your delegation, as well as the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary, and the chairman and members of the Transport Committee, who closely followed these issues and managed to achieve real advances on the text of the Council's common position, particularly in relation to passengers' rights.
I am pleased that the 'package' approach taken by Parliament and the Commission has been successful.
It has enabled us to have these two texts adopted just two-and-a-half years after the Commission produced the proposals - even though the number of Member States practically doubled in the interval.
I have to acknowledge, Mr President, that it was Parliament's tenacity which has resulted in the parallel adoption of the amended Regulation on public passenger transport services by rail and by road.
It was by no means obvious two years ago that we would get this far.
I extend my thanks to the House.
I should like now to outline briefly what has been achieved on each of the three texts.
Let me begin with the opening up of the market in international rail passenger traffic.
Two issues dominated discussions at the conciliation stage, namely the report that the Commission is to prepare on implementing the opening up of the international passenger services market and the levying of a charge towards the financing of public services.
On the first point, Parliament was keen for the Commission's report to include the opening up of the domestic services market and to be accompanied by an appropriate legislative proposal.
The conciliation committee came up with a compromise whereby the Commission's report will include an analysis of the prospects for opening domestic markets to competition.
This will take account of experience in applying the rules on public services, and of the differences between Member States.
If necessary, Mr Jarzembowski, the Commission report will also propose complementary measures to facilitate the gradual opening up of the market.
I am aware that, from your point of view, the compromise ought to have been more ambitious, but it has two advantages.
It allows us to implement the new legislative framework, including the provisions for public services.
It also sets a clear time scale for detailed analysis of the impact of this new legislative framework in all the Member States.
So we will have an opportunity to consider the relevance of complementary proposals by the Commission.
The second focus of negotiation was the levying of a charge towards the financing of public services.
A number of Member States hoped that all rail services within their territory, whether national or international and irrespective of their providers, would contribute collectively to the financing of public passenger transport services, via the levying of a charge.
When the Council adopted its common position, the Commission accepted this as a possibility insofar as it was compatible with Community law.
The compromise reached in the conciliation committee took on board several elements from Parliament's second reading.
I am grateful to the parliamentary delegation for giving it their support and I can assure you that I am committed to completing this legislation to the best of my ability.
That brings me, Mr Savary, to the certification of train staff.
Apart from the more or less technical questions that were easily resolved prior to the final meeting, two issues still had to be addressed: partial reimbursement of training costs if a driver left a company early; and the directive's field of application.
The solution reached on the partial reimbursement of training costs was to ask the Member States to address the problem through national measures because, at the end of the day, harmonisation of their solutions was not essential.
With regard to the field of application, I think we have found the best solution.
The European Railway Agency will commission a more detailed study of the profile and tasks of those members of staff on trains who contribute to their security.
We will then be in a position to target our proposals more effectively for those staff, but you were quite right to highlight how extremely important this question of train crew certification is.
I will move on now, Mr Sterckx, to rail passengers' rights and obligations.
The final phase of the negotiations focused on the field of application of the regulation on rail passengers' rights.
From the outset, Parliament was keen to see these rights introduced for all railway services, including national services.
However, a large number of Member States felt that this would pose major difficulties, particularly when it came to applying the regulation to local services, the characteristics of which are quite different from those of international or long-distance services.
In the end, the solution contained two key elements: a new distinction between types of service, and lengthy transition periods.
The key parameters for application of the rules are now about long or short distance, with short-distance services including urban, suburban and regional rail links.
So the regulation no longer refers to 'national' and 'international' services.
This new arrangement, to which you made a substantial and skilful contribution, Mr Sterckx, enabled us to reach agreement on what had been the main sticking point.
This solution concerning the field of application has many advantages: it accords better with the internal market than the initially envisaged parameters depending on a national/international dimension; it gives the Member States more flexibility because, in defining at national level what constitute urban, suburban and regional services, within the framework fixed by the regulation, it will be possible to take account objectively of the dimension and structure of the territory in question.
The compromise has also deferred application of certain sections of the regulation for a transition period of five years, which may be renewed twice.
This solution lessens the immediate burden on the railway companies, while retaining the obligation to transpose the rights that the regulation establishes into national law.
This means there can be no let-up in the railways companies' efforts as they look to the future.
I would remind you, too, that the regulation will include a minimum core of rights that will apply, without exemptions, from the moment that it comes into force.
These rights concern availability of tickets, civil liability in the event of accident, passengers' personal security in stations, and non-discrimination in respect of passengers with reduced mobility.
Quite a lot, in other words!
It is a good outcome and it will enable us in future to offer rail passengers a better service.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have shown that together we can move things forward.
Clearly this is just one stage.
We will now have to attend to the proper application of the rules that Parliament and the Council have adopted.
The Commission, in its role as guardian of the Treaties, will work untiringly to that effect.
Because I arrived slightly late, having come straight from Cyprus, I missed hearing the three rapporteurs, but I did catch Mr Savary's point that interoperability is vital to the Europeanisation of the railways.
It is the price to be paid for shifting a proportion of our freight traffic onto rail - and we recognise today just how advantageous that will be, particularly in terms of our priority of tackling global warming.
Of course, this package is not perfect, but it has the great merit of being a reality and I cannot adequately express my appreciation, Mr President, of all the MEPs who contributed to its adoption; for us too, it marks the beginning of a new stage, in which I personally intend to invest considerable commitment and vigilance.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, many of us probably know the story of the Captain of Köpenick, and many of us have also laughed at what happened.
Yet that story was not and is not all that funny.
Just because someone is wearing a uniform, that does not mean he can or should have or claim any powers.
It is not so very long ago that rail passengers in Europe, in our Member States, came across many little Köpenicks.
The conductor was an official, the customer was not - he was subservient.
European Community legislation has breathed a lot of fresh air into those quasi-government structures and there has been a great deal of change in the space of surprisingly few years.
Monopolies and quasi-monopolies are slowly and increasingly becoming service industries more or less subject to competition.
Passengers are acquiring rights.
That is the subject I want to address.
In the Sterckx report the European Parliament set itself very ambitious objectives overall.
Our key objective was to ensure that where possible all passengers are guaranteed the same or similar passenger rights, regardless of the train they are in; in particular, this must not be restricted to international travel.
Parliament regarded it as unacceptable for people to be treated differently on the same train.
The compromise that was reached with difficulty during conciliation did not entirely achieve that aim, but it almost did.
All passengers now have basic rights in very important areas: liability, rights of persons with reduced mobility, information, and then, stage by stage and at times unfortunately with very long transitional periods, further-reaching rights for all.
The key achievements are something to be proud of, especially when compared to air passenger rights, another matter we consider important.
They include fines, compensation for delays, improved access for persons with reduced mobility, wheelchairs, accompanying persons, and better information on all those aspects.
This will continue to be a major task in future too, so that we can ensure that passengers can claim their rights even if people in uniform treat them dismissively or distantly.
One final word, to avoid any misunderstandings.
As it stands, the new directive does not yet apply entirely to local services - urban, suburban and regional services.
We will have to introduce separate rules for local public transport, to ensure that there too customers are treated like kings and not servants.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, perhaps I could start by saying that our objective in the European Parliament and in the European Union is to serve the people well and, as regards transport policy, to try to provide some genuine opportunities for growth, to give railways a new culture of growth and development, giving them an entrepreneurial nature and organisation and new opportunities for market growth.
The package that has been presented to us fulfils these two fundamental objectives.
For this reason I would like to say right at the beginning that we shall be voting in favour.
I would like to talk about the report by Mr Jarzembowski.
The first fundamental issue is the field of application of the new regulation, which relates to international railway passenger services.
During the work of the committee we examined and discussed, including in bilateral discussions with the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, the possibility of going one or even two steps further by liberalising national services too.
However, we accept the scope of the regulation as presented to us, which covers international, not cross-border, services, with the possibility of picking up and setting down passengers between stations within every Member State.
This is an effective and workable solution and we will vote in favour.
The second and more controversial area, also mentioned by Commissioner Barrot, is the possibility of introducing payments where there are negative consequences of liberalisation or threats to the efficiency and effectiveness of a country's passenger transport system and provision of public services.
This point aroused concern and controversy.
The proposed solution may work in practice and the Commission will, of course, have to work closely with the Member States.
By the way, we are having great difficulty with the Polish translation, which does not convey the meaning.
The third very important aspect is the report assessing the effects of this liberalisation in 2012.
This is very important.
We also agree that liberalisation is the right approach, though there is something of a difference between my Group's position on this and, for example, the statement made by Mr Sterckx.
I would like to make it quite clear that this package forms a whole.
The reports by Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary mean that there really will be a new level of quality.
I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary and Mr Sterckx.
I think that we should also give special recognition to the approach adopted by Commissioner Barrot, the Directorate-General concerned and the German Presidency.
Of course in the next few years we might be able to see a synergy effect on the whole railway transport system in Europe, particularly passenger services.
For this reason I feel very satisfied, even though as a representative of a new Member State I have a few concerns: if there is a free market for train drivers then we could start having a flow of drivers leaving the country, but perhaps it might also act as a stimulant.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have always wholeheartedly backed the EU transport strategy, which is aimed at strengthening rail transport, as regards both passenger transport and freight transport.
The best tools for this are liberalisation and freer competition, which causes train companies to take a greater interest in the wishes of customers.
Increased competition will pave the way for rail transport to become more competitive and financially sustainable, and at the same time we will secure equal competition in relation to other forms of transport.
Road taxes will naturally be looked at with this in mind.
This year the first railway package came into force with the liberalisation of freight transport, and this evening we will consider the compromise concerning the third railway package, which will introduce further liberalisation, albeit far less ambitiously than we in the ALDE Group would have liked.
On the other hand, passengers' rights have been secured, and an agreement has been reached concerning the common training of train drivers, who are, of course, a very important element in creating more efficient train operations across borders.
As my group's rapporteur on the Directive on the certification of onboard personnel, I would particularly like to thank rapporteur Mr Savary for the results that we have achieved.
My group has particularly emphasised the fact that a reasonable solution has been found as regards financing.
We are therefore glad that training costs will be refunded if a locomotive driver changes job shortly after completing his training.
This training is expensive, after all, and we must not create a system whereby some rail companies are freewheeling and systematically avoiding paying their fair share of training costs by recruiting newly trained staff from other companies.
With regard to the personnel to be covered, we are satisfied with the fact that train drivers will be covered initially, while the question of including other personnel involved in safety will be assessed again in 30 months' time.
It has been difficult to reach an agreement on which rail carriers should be covered by the passenger's rights.
In Parliament we have maintained that national transport - and not just the 5% of passenger transport that crosses borders - should be covered.
We succeeded in this, and a formula has also been found that ensures that passengers have fundamental rights.
This is important.
However, I have difficulty in understanding why passenger's rights cannot be extended to cover all rail operations.
The work relating to this legislation and Parliament's proposals concerning passenger rights has actually inspired the rail companies in my own country, Denmark, to voluntarily implement rules on passenger compensation.
This means that commuters are now also entitled to compensation when they are affected by delays, which does happen on occasion, of course.
Commuters are very important; we will secure good conditions and ensure that they experience rail transport as a good alternative to other, more energy-intensive forms of transport.
It has been very apparent during the negotiations that the desire to alter the framework conditions for rail companies in the EU brings out strong emotions.
On the one hand, we would all like to have more rail transport.
On the other, there is considerable concern that national companies will be unable to cope with the competition.
In addition, there is not always strong enthusiasm for change amongst either rail companies or trade unions.
However, there are also some rail companies that are taking up the challenge and modernising and creating new organisational forms that secure effective door-to-door transport through the use of several modes of transport.
This is the future too, of course.
As politicians, we will establish frameworks that ensure that those who wish to provide competitive, effective and modern transport services have the opportunity they need to deliver.
I fully understand those who are fighting to retain their old privileges, but this is simply not the agenda that we politicians must pursue.
We will secure attractive, effective and safe rail transport.
I feel that the result that we have achieved is a step forward, and I would like to thank all three rapporteurs for their efforts.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his fundamental role in achieving a step along the path towards improving the efficiency of rail transport in Europe.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank all three of my fellow rapporteurs and also Mr Vidal-Quadras, head of the European Parliament's delegation during the conciliation procedure.
Certainly, nobody is completely satisfied - not the rapporteurs, businesses, Parliament or the Council - but the best compromises are always those in which none of the parties can consider themselves to be one hundred per cent victorious.
It seems to me that the European Parliament's most important success is the resolute position on passenger rights, and another gain is the term 'basic passenger's rights'- and it is particularly significant that this was achieved in relation to persons with special needs - as well as the achievement concerning the railway companies' liability for baggage.
Certainly, we can express regret that the increased rights are entering into force in a limited way, and also at that fact that the entire package of additional passenger's rights in cities and on regional routes will, in the majority of countries, not be guaranteed for 15 years at the earliest.
I am glad that competition is coming to international rail transport from 2010, according to Mr Jarzembowski's report, but even though a further step has been taken on internal transport, and there is at least a clear procedure under which the Commission must carry out analysis, this decision was not adopted with any deadline.
Similarly, I regret two aspects: the first is that a few countries that are Member States, including my own country, Latvia, in fact have no international passenger rail connection with EU countries at all.
As a whole, the operation of the entire package in the European Union is, as a result, partially restricted: it does not operate across the whole of the enlarged European Union and some Member States are, overall, little affected.
A second point that I certainly regret is that it was not possible to achieve improvements on the issue of freight with regard to the quality of transport.
I hope that this will happen in the future.
I will end, though, as I began, with a positive thought - we have achieved a result, and particularly with regard to passenger rights it is undoubtedly a positive one.
Thank you.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, the report now before us is a third-reading compromise and can broadly be described as a victory for the European Parliament over the Council, over the Member States that are often over-protective of their national rail authorities and shield them off.
I must, therefore, compliment the three rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary and Mr Sterckx.
Following negotiations with the Council and the Commission, they managed to incorporate many of Parliament's demands at first and second reading into the final document.
Passengers on European railways will now gain stronger rights, both domestically and internationally.
As a frequent rail traveller, especially in Italy, that pleases me and I hope Trenitalia also has to introduce European standards.
I would like to give a small example that shows that things are not nearly as customer-friendly on Italian trains as Mr Rack described earlier, saying that much had already improved.
Until about 20 years ago, a station with a catchment area of 20 000 inhabitants and almost twice as many tourists during the high season still had a ticket office that was always open and manned by officials.
Since then, not only has the ticket office closed down but the station is now completely unmanned.
There is a ticket machine in a very dismal area.
Last summer it was out of order for weeks.
A note was stuck on it regretting that it was out of order.
Nonetheless customers were told they needed a valid ticket to board the train.
With that sort of service on stations it is quite incomprehensible why one cannot also buy a ticket on the train, as in other countries.
Since a short while ago, anybody caught without a ticket on an Italian train actually has to pay a EUR 50 fine.
I very much hope that deplorable situations of the kind on the Italian railways will soon become a thing of the past.
I could quote many other examples, particularly of information systems not working.
I very much hope that the Swiss Federal Railways will be taken as a model.
In Switzerland the passenger really is treated like a favoured customer whom the railway administration serves, instead of being regarded as a nuisance and often merely as a disruptive factor for the railway.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, the three reports presented again at third reading as the third railway package are concerned with a variety of very different issues.
The most pressing of these issues is the need for train drivers to be able to stay at the controls when crossing national borders rather than having to hand over to their foreign colleagues.
From the point of view of train crews all three versions had room for improvement.
But my Group is happy with the compromises reached by the rapporteur, Mr Savary, and we shall support version three in the vote.
On passengers' rights in international rail transport, we have let an opportunity slip.
One area in which the European Union can do something useful is offering maximum safeguards for international rail passengers against the negative effects of competition, unnecessary fragmentation amongst rail operators and national short-sightedness.
The European Commission put forward a good proposal to provide a good long-distance service, as before, in respect of ticket sales and information.
Due to competition and cost-cutting that service is increasingly restricted to individual Member States and their immediate environs.
Germany alone has a good system here and all other railway undertakings would do well to emulate its example.
At Mr Sterckx's instigation a majority of the House has markedly shifted the emphasis elsewhere.
Far more attention is now being paid to compensation for delays in domestic rail services and far less to the steady deterioration in international services.
In reply to passengers who complain that they waste time unnecessarily because they have to buy another ticket once they have crossed the border, the Commission says that it came up with a good proposal but that the European Parliament blocked it.
Because there is no better alternative at the moment, and because we approve other parts of these proposals, we shall vote in favour of this end result.
We shall continue to press for the improvements which formed the nucleus of the original proposal and which, sadly, are missing.
For my Group, the third part remains the most controversial.
Not only now, but also in the two earlier railway packages Mr Jarzembowski has advocated more competition and the operation of market forces.
That starts with international freight transport, but ultimately encompasses all rail traffic including domestic passenger traffic.
This means that the poorer working conditions in freight transport by road and air also become the norm in rail transport.
My Group thinks it should have been the other way round, leading to better safeguards in and regulation of road and air transport.
We do not agree that competition is a better answer than good cooperation between national railway undertakings to the problems in international freight transport or even passenger transport.
And we shall not be voting for these proposals in the third reading.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, harmonisation of railways across 27 states has very little attraction to the UK.
Competition may be good for commerce, but you can leave us out, as we will deal with the economics of running our own service.
If the standardisation process necessarily involves change of track widths, widths of platforms or changes of voltage on electrified lines, as it will in some parts of the EU, then good luck to you all, but leave us out.
Such is the magnitude of legislation from this place on railways that we will be surprised if a private operator can be found who can jump through all the hoops at anything like economic cost.
We have only one rail link with the continent and this passes through a very useful tunnel.
Bearing in mind that we are all being railroaded by these directives due to one single tunnel, it may lead some to say that the Channel Tunnel should be concreted up in the middle and the British and the French could then use their respective halves for the safe storage of nuclear waste.
This would eradicate the expensive need to harmonise a rail link to the UK, as no rail link would exist.
Please try to control the endless stream of directives from this place.
Or, to put it another way, railways run on sleepers; what a pity this place does not run on similar lines.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that rail transport has always been the poor relation compared with road transport.
Indeed, with regard to goods traffic, rail has been losing the battle in every country in Europe.
I am pleased to say that the situation today looks set to improve, particularly since the Commission's decision - as part of the first Railway Package - that at least 40% of spending on transport should go to the railways.
Infrastructure, in particular, needs to benefit from this spending because all the closures of non-profitable railway lines have resulted in road transport taking over a significant proportion of both freight and passenger traffic.
Of my colleague Dirck Sterckx's report concerning rail passengers' rights and obligations I would say that it is essentially sound, focusing as it does on the protection of passengers, with measures including compensation when trains are late, a right to transport for people with reduced mobility, and carrier liability for passengers and their baggage.
However, one point of major importance to all families appears to have been completely lost in this report.
I am talking about the right to reduced ticket prices for large families.
Certain Member States of the Union already have this system whereby a card entitles large families to reductions of between 50% and 75% depending on the number of children - France is one example - yet curiously there are no proposals or even plans for such an arrangement in the draft regulation.
However, if we want to step up the development of passenger traffic on the railways, this measure, which is attractive not only financially but also in terms of savings on travel time in comparison with road transport, would undoubtedly give us a strong card in the rail-versus-road battle.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I do not know if the same sayings are used in other countries, but in Poland people say that the railways are a state within a state, or that no one has yet won a battle with the railways.
It is therefore even more welcome that, after a great deal of work, the third Railway Package is coming into force and that the ordinary citizen will be able to win a battle with the railways, if, of course, they are in the right.
All of this is thanks to the fact that we are approving something that could be called a charter of fundamental rights for the railway passenger, i.e. basic passenger rights.
These include the right to obtain information about one's rights, which is very important, the right to insurance and compensation and even the right to free movement for the disabled.
This is an issue that requires particular attention and should be carefully monitored.
It should apply equally to small railway stations and to regional ones.
There are of course those among us who would like these rights to be more extensive and less restricted.
We are introducing certain limitations. I would not, however, like to hide my satisfaction at what we have achieved.
I am certain that, knowing the determination of the European Parliament, we shall not stop at this point and we shall gradually act to extend these rights.
I would like, therefore, to congratulate all the rapporteurs, the members of the Conciliation Committee, the Council and the Commission.
I would like to congratulate them because I believe we have taken a great step forward.
It is an important step, because it is a step forward for the people.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs and everyone in the Council and Commission who helped to secure this outcome.
We have reached the end of a very lengthy process and the result, naturally, is a compromise which does not make anyone a hundred percent happy but does not make anyone a hundred percent unhappy either.
We all want the future for rail transport to be rosy, but we disagree rather on how this is to be achieved.
I would repeat what I have said on this before, namely that I do not see liberalisation alone, always, in all circumstances, as a miracle solution.
On the contrary, in many cases it will bring additional problems, certainly if it interferes with the public service obligation at local or regional level.
What does work - as the railway undertakings in a number of Member States show - is additional investment in comfort, punctuality and attractive pricing, and that of course requires political commitment.
Speaking personally, I am especially glad that we have successfully approved an equally important proposal on the liberalisation of rail passenger transport.
We want to open up the market in international passenger transport and make it more attractive, but without fully liberalising domestic passenger transport.
Opening up the market also means cabotage, but it can be restricted slightly if this cabotage right jeopardises the economic balance of public service contracts.
I know that a majority of my colleagues, admittedly not a qualified majority, were in favour of liberalising national passenger transport but, whilst that might perhaps be problem-free in some countries, I am convinced that in some other situations it most certainly would create problems, not least due to the big differences in the density and structure of rail networks; so an approach tailored individually to each Member State has to be adopted.
This Directive, in conjunction with the Regulation on public service obligations, will provide a sound legal framework for this kind of customised approach.
On the matter of passengers' rights it is clear that Parliament was keen, across party lines, to be a little more ambitious and to secure a higher level of rights for all rail passengers Europe-wide.
The fact that this remains de facto impossible for urban and regional transport is regrettable.
It is also unfortunate that long-distance domestic transport can enjoy exemption from this Regulation for up to 15 years, but it is certain that within two years all passengers on international trains will have a number of basic rights and that some Member States will emerge as trendsetters by making good use of the lengthy transitional period.
And we must give every encouragement here: Europe's mills grind slowly, but they grind.
Little by little we shall improve passengers' rights.
Bearing in mind what a regulation on passenger rights in air travel has achieved, I urge the Commission to carry out the necessary assessments without undue delay and take any initiatives needed to close any back doors, so that this Regulation does not fail to deliver on its promises.
Lastly, Commissioner, please publicise the content of the regulation promptly and on a wide scale so that all rail passengers are properly informed of the rights they have now acquired.
(PL) Mr President, Europe is supposed to be for the people, the citizens, and not for the political classes, for the elites, or the chattering classes.
Recently the European Parliament forced through a reduction in the prices of international telephone calls from mobile telephones.
This was a concrete achievement.
Today we have a similar opportunity to take direct action on behalf of Europeans from the 27 Member States, on behalf of European railway passengers, who, from 2010 or 2012 will be able to travel more easily in their own countries and throughout the European Union.
This is another concrete step forward.
It is similar to the change concerning passengers' rights to financial compensation for delayed trains.
Today the situation in the European Union from this point of view is certainly better than in India and Russia (I have personal experience of these), but the European taxpayer is still unable, in practice, to demand compensation if the railway works badly.
I would like to remind you that last year Parliament, acting with the Commission and the Council, fought to have similar compensation for airline passengers.
This was another concrete achievement by the European Parliament.
For railway passengers we are talking about 25% of the ticket price for a delay of less than two hours and 50% of the ticket price for delays of over two hours.
These proposals are far more significant for Member States than sterile political disputes, even on the subject of the constitution.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, regarding the controversial proposal by Mr Georg Jarzembowski, in the approved text we have succeeded in allowing passengers to be picked up or set down from trains at any station on an international route, including stations located in the same Member State.
I trust that it will by extension be possible to apply this provision to international bus services.
This issue was actually the subject of several international disputes recently.
Regarding the report by Mr Savary, I am pleased that it includes the rights of the social partners and specifications for interoperability.
However, problems concerning the financing of training, the choice of examiners and examinations for train drivers still exist.
As far as language skills are concerned, it is essential to insist on certain minimum requirements in order to ensure transport safety.
Regarding the report by Mr Sterckx, I appreciate the request for the introduction of non-discriminatory access rules for persons with reduced mobility and cyclists.
Although the text also lays down a range of clearly defined technical requirements, I am not pleased that unlike the Swiss railways we talk about penalising rather than efforts to satisfy the demand for a transport service.
All of the above measures should be reassessed within two years of their introduction; this is crucial in my opinion.
We will vote against the first report and in favour of the other two.
(NL) Mr President, in my earlier contribution to the debate on this third Railway Package I intimated that not every outcome from this dossier would delight me.
Several months down the road my conclusion is that the agreement reached with the Council represents a constructive step towards further completion of the European rail transport market, in several important respects.
Realisation of the single rail market regularly encounters practical difficulties, and with this package we have eliminated some of them.
For a long time it was uncertain whether Parliament was not going too fast in seeking an agreement between Council and Parliament, whether it was not addressing problems which did not actually exist or which, if addressed, would throw up fresh problems.
I am thinking above all of liberalisation of the domestic passenger transport market and the achievement of rules on train crew certification.
The end-agreement between Council and Parliament reflects a good balance between efforts to resolve existing problems and a realistic scenario for the future as regards expanding the scope of the present agreements.
On the whole issue of market access the most important thing is that account should be taken of existing contracts.
That will enable otherwise inevitable breaches of contract and related claims to be avoided.
The idea of the levy to finance public service obligations is acceptable under current conditions.
Compared with the agreements on market access and certification the scope of these agreements on passengers' rights is as broad in principle as it can be.
In view of the reciprocal agreements in the sector I think that is a good thing.
The agreements reached are largely a reflection of voluntary agreements in the sector and that is something I warmly welcome.
As a keen cyclist I am especially pleased by the provisions for carrying bicycles on the train.
These will hopefully make a real contribution towards easing congestion problems.
It is a fine example of co-modality in passenger transport.
In conclusion I must thank the rapporteurs for their hard work and congratulate them on the outcome.
Thanks to their efforts we are a little closer to a common European rail market.
My thanks too, of course, to the German Presidency and to Commissioner Barrot.
(PT) Despite the fact that trains continue to offer a safe, environmentally-friendly means of transport, capable of carrying large volumes of goods and passengers comfortably and speedily, with a high quality of service, the truth of the matter is that an open, competitive railway system in the Community area is still a long way off.
Liberalisation is the only way to achieve the right financial and technological conditions for attracting investment and to provide the necessary impetus in order to make the railways more attractive and efficient and to achieve greater interoperability.
The negotiation of the Third Railway Package is another step in this direction and we hope that the combined will of the Council, the Commission and the Parliament reflected in that package will send out a strong and coherent political message, a message which is capable of mobilising the long-term investment which this sector needs.
I would like to congratulate our fellow Members, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary and Mr Stercks, for their excellent work which has enabled us to discuss principles and guidelines today in relation to various matters.
For example, the matter of access to the market for international passenger services by rail from 2010 and the question of agreement in the sensitive area of the charges to be applied to international passenger transport services, where it is necessary to safeguard both the financing of the relevant public service and the economic viability of transporters.
It should be noted that this process will now be followed up because the opening up of the railways market is to be the subject of a new Commission communication, scheduled for 2012.
Likewise, in the field of certification of train drivers, notable progress has been made over certificates and licences which in future, thanks to the Parliament, will certainly cover all train crew dealing with safety and, finally, there has been significant progress in the complex area of passenger rights and obligations with regard to compensation for delays and guaranteed mobility, for example, with a view to improving the efficiency and attractiveness of international passenger transport by rail.
Mr President, we all know that there is a very long road between the drafting of legislation and its full implementation and it is that road which we must travel if we are to achieve dynamic and coherent development of this mode of transport.
(ES) This evening marks a new stage in the modernisation, indeed Europeanisation, of rail transport, with the establishment of common ground rules.
Mr Jarzembowski's report, which carries out Parliament's mandate to the full, shows that an agreement has been reached that is satisfactory for all parties, despite the present imbalance between countries that have open networks, those that have put time and effort into modernising their infrastructure - in Spain, for example, with regard to the track gauge problem - and those who need more time to achieve the minimum level required in order to compete on equal terms.
All in all, it is extremely important that the final agreement reflected in the Jarzembowski report preserves the Commission's right to decide what proposal it will submit for the final stage.
In this sector, secure and sustainable as we know it and want it to be, it is essential that we proceed in a secure and sustainable manner.
We believed the most difficult part would be the opening-up of the rail networks; in the end the human aspect proved the most complex.
What is important is not simply the agreement on train drivers as such, but the fact that Mr Savary succeeded in establishing quickly and firmly the conditions for trains to be driven by drivers who have their training and certification in common.
And we also have a promise that other crew members will be able to operate under the same or similar conditions in the not too distant future.
As I was saying, what proved most difficult in the end were the rights and obligations of rail passengers.
To have reached agreement that these will apply to national as well as international rail travel is a fundamental achievement.
Our citizens would not have understood that something should be agreed at international level when they have to put up with these conditions daily at national level.
While not as comprehensive as we would have wished, a secure basis has been established for the rights of all passengers to prompt and efficient information and assistance.
We know this is not enough.
We want to go further, and campaigning organisations - particularly, in my country, the National Organisation for the Blind - have asked for more.
We must continue, but we believe that this evening with the Sterckx report we have opened up a promising avenue for progress.
As we conclude this stage, an equally promising stage is beginning that requires our full commitment.
We still have to deal with interoperability, all the safety aspects that need to be strengthened and Europeanised, and the task of putting flesh on the bones of the Agency.
Finally, there remains the great challenge of a European rail network for goods transport - the Commission's forthcoming proposals for a dedicated goods transport network - and all the logistical support required in order to make the European nodes that are being established today into a real transport network for the future.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for his work in preparing a text for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Directive on the development of the Community's railways and on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges.
The text of the directive was agreed through the conciliation procedure.
This directive will be important for the continuing development of the Community's railways, for passengers and for freight traffic.
The railways, which are already two centuries old, are becoming more important in today's world because of environmental protection as well as congestion on the roads.
The problems as regards developing rail transport will be funds for modernisation and for constructing and equipping new networks.
In order to achieve harmonious growth, poor countries will need considerable financial support.
The text that has been agreed for the new directive will have a positive impact on further growth in the railways.
Mr Savary's report on the rights of train drivers and Mr Sterckx's report on rights and obligations cover further issues relating to railway transport.
I would like to congratulate them on their work.
(EL) Mr President, the third rail package agreement is another step towards selling off the people's wealth.
Public property is being sold to capital in order to multiply profits at the expense of the working classes and to increase their exploitation.
The regulation of rights and obligations contained in the package is no more than sugaring the pill of passenger transport deregulation.
Railway workers have expressed their vehement opposition to the deregulation of rail transport both in the two previous packages and in the present one.
We, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, are opposed to the selling off of the railways, especially in Greece, where rail transport is far removed from the people's needs and in many cases continues to operate with obsolete infrastructure and equipment.
We side with the workers who are fighting for the development of public transport.
We need a public rail service guaranteeing safe, high-quality transport, which will both meet the current needs of workers and be environmentally-friendly.
We will therefore vote against the agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
We point to the responsibility of the EU and the governments of the Member States in this anti-popular policy and in the plundering of the people's wealth by capital.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as one of those who started the collection of signatures entitled 'One Million for Disability' I encouraged men and women throughout Europe to actively support people with disabilities.
In early October the signatures will be handed over to the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Parliament to urge them also to do more to support a social Europe.
Today, almost on the eve of that occasion, we are debating the third rail package, which is also and from my point of view very specifically concerned with the rights and obligations of rail passengers.
A substantial part of the regulation focuses on the rights and obligations of persons with reduced mobility, whether as a result of age, disability or any other factor, and - particularly noteworthy - of any accompanying persons.
They have the same right to freedom of movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination as all other citizens.
It has been a great victory on the part of the European Parliament that this part of the rail package will apply not only to international but also to domestic services.
That expands all rail passengers' user rights and improves the quality and effectiveness of rail passenger services.
It means all travellers have a right to information about rail services both before and during the journey.
Gradually all buildings and vehicles will also be made accessible to persons with reduced mobility.
Passengers will have more rights to compensation and assistance in the event of delays, missed connections or cancelled trains, and the complaints procedure that was lacking in the past will create trust between passengers and service providers.
All those factors will make using the train more attractive.
Unfortunately, Member States can still apply temporary exemptions, yet this result does mean we are safely on the right road.
Now the Member States can prove how serious they were in March this year when they signed the UN Charter on persons with disabilities.
I expect my country, Germany, to set a good example in transposing the rights of persons with disabilities.
I thank the rapporteurs and all those who conducted the negotiations during the conciliation procedure and recommend endorsing this package.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, the certification of train drivers is an important step forward Community transport legislation, one which is capable of kick-starting the revitalisation of the Community rail network, and Gilles Savary has played a vital role in this process.
It is also possible to promote use of the railways by creating incentives for improving the quality of service and by reinforcing the rights of drivers and passengers, thereby favouring modal equality.
The revitalisation of rail transport in the European Union makes an important contribution towards a sustainable transport system and towards the creation of the single European market.
This legislation will therefore strengthen the railways component of the single market, especially as regards international passenger transport, an area which is covered by the proposal for a directive to open up the market for international passenger services by rail.
Procedures have also been laid down for certifying train drivers in the European Union and the legal provisions which we have been debating also strengthen the rights of rail passengers, hence the importance of discussing these three reports and three directives.
The report on a joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the rail network in the Community therefore establishes specific legal provisions recognising professional attainment with a view to ensuring the mobility of train drivers throughout Europe and at the same time improving the mobility of international rail travel in the European Union.
These are positive steps which are to be welcomed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures needed to achieve interoperability have been thoroughly examined by harmonising the legislation concerning the training of train drivers and their certification, which is also a very positive step.
Significant progress has therefore been made towards achieving the railways component of the internal market by providing a clear guarantee of the rights of workers, undertakings and passengers, who are after all the European citizens who elected us.
Finally I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs Dirk Stercks and Georg Jarzembowski and, last but not least, Gilles Savary, for all their hard work.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
(NL) Mr President, sincere thanks to the rapporteurs and to Vice-President Vidal-Quadras Roca for their hard work in securing a successful outcome on this complicated third Railway Package.
Some of the rapporteurs, Mr President, may feel they have to make the best of a bad job, having hoped to achieve far more, but I think the result we have is commendable in all respects.
It is a positive development that all rail passengers in Europe now have a number of basic rights.
The ability and the right of people with reduced mobility to travel are now much better regulated.
It is also good that additional rules on long-distance travel have been made compulsory, but those rules are not appropriate for urban and regional transport, so it is good that these have been exempted and will come under a different set of rules.
Mr President, we have had a substantial debate on the liberalisation of rail transport.
Not only with the Council, but here in Parliament too.
I am happy with the outcome.
Liberalisation was the right way to go on international rail transport, but not on national rail transport.
Mr President, the differences between Member States are too great to impose the national liberalisation of domestic rail links in a 'top-down' manner from Europe, because busy regional networks are fragile and there has to be scope for putting put these out to private tender.
That too is a form of competition.
I am happy with that outcome.
It is cautious competition, but appropriate to these complex networks, I think.
Mr Barrot says the Commission will be analysing prospects for the further liberalisation of domestic passenger transport; I expressly urge him to include in that analysis the question of putting networks out to private tender and how far that may benefit the operation of the market.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to welcome the fact that the inter-institutional Conciliation Committee has managed to reach agreement, and that the market in international rail passenger transport services within the European Union will therefore be opened up in 2010.
Liberalisation is a good move ... (the President interrupted the speaker); open competition is a necessity in the passenger transport services market.
It will not only contribute to implementing rail transport reform, but at the same time will create the kind of competitive situation in which the main winners will be the consumers themselves.
However, we cannot just go straight ahead and force national rail companies into free market competition, since several Member States' rail companies are facing financial difficulties.
In addition, their infrastructure is often exceptionally underdeveloped.
We therefore need to support their development efforts and we must allow them time to become competitive so that they are able to hold their own in the battle to win passengers.
Alongside liberalisation, it is at least as important to enhance passenger confidence in rail services by improving, extending and internationalising passenger rights.
The new legislation means that rail service providers will have to assume greater responsibility.
Harmonisation of EU legislation on the rights and obligations of passengers, information, assumption of liability for passengers and their luggage, the issue of compensation, handling of delays and provision for passengers with reduced mobility are all things that increase safety and at the same time enhance the reputation of rail service providers.
It is an ambitious goal, but absolutely essential for facilitating development of the European high-speed rail network and cross-border operating arrangements relating to it.
At the same time, it also increases confidence with regard to domestic rail passenger transport.
Increasing efficiency and improving rail network and service quality are truly fundamental not only in terms of developing a sustainable transport sector but also in terms of overcrowding and air pollution.
Of course, alongside the new legislative package, in the interests of improving quality we must also ensure that the directive is appropriately transposed into national law.
In view of these issues, the implementation report due in 2012 will be especially important, as will the companies' annual reports.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and all those who contributed to the success of the negotiations; thanks to you we will at last be able to vote on this issue tomorrow.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(DE) Mr President, I too would first like to thank the rapporteurs for their work - it was no easy job.
After all, the third rail package is the continuation of a long process of opening up the European rail sector to competition and harmonising standards in Europe.
Like many earlier speakers, I particularly welcome the proposed regulation on the rights and obligations of passengers.
Here, for the first time, uniform rules are being introduced throughout Europe to strengthen passengers' rights.
As Mr Koch very clearly explained, among other things the regulation covers the provision of suitable access to trains, stations and platforms for persons with reduced mobility.
It covers liability in the event of injury or death. It covers the creation of a system of compensation for train delays and cancellations.
It is high time that not just air passengers but rail passengers also acquire minimum rights.
It is only at first sight that this regulation appears to place a burden on railway undertakings.
In the end, granting passengers minimum rights makes the railways more attractive.
Strengthening passengers' rights makes a considerable contribution to promoting rail travel, which will result in an increase in the overall share of this mode of transport.
Travel by rail is finally to become a real alternative to flying within Europe.
That is important in terms of the climate issue.
The Commission proposal provided for the introduction of passengers' rights only for international rail travel.
I am glad that we managed to ensure that its scope is now extended to all rail passengers, especially of course to domestic railways and not just to passengers in international rail services.
It is after all incomprehensible for a passenger on a train from Cologne to Brussels to enjoy passengers' rights while someone taking a train from Frankfurt to Cologne is not entitled to the same rights.
It is a pity, though, that we have to be satisfied with the compromise of possibly having long transitional periods before these rights are implemented.
The consumer will not understand that.
(RO) Mr. President, this legislative package has a truly European connotation, both in principle, and in essence, although it still keeps the designation "international”, while militating for the internal market development.
For this stage, a distinction is still necessary and is an important step in creating an integrated railway network in the European Union.
Member States have the possibility to more efficiently amortize their long term investments, which are absolutely necessary for special infrastructure.
The services maintenance and quality costs may decrease to the benefit of passengers who, in their turn, will have the freedom to choose between commercial services and public services, at the same time having their rights guaranteed.
Moreover, by cabotage, all passengers can have access to competitive services.
Nevertheless, we have to admit that, in the new Member States, such as Romania, operations still go ahead under disadvantageous conditions.
For this reason, liberalization must be analyzed and approached differently from case to case, focusing on improving interoperability and cooperation in transborder sectors, as well as by reexamining priorities within the instruments of financing investments in special infrastructures.
Moreover, the Union has to prepare for the true challenge: to create a functional integrated network with the railway systems of neighbouring countries, by Trans-European Transport Networks and by Pan-European corridors, observing the expansion and facilitation of access to Central and Eastern Asia.
I specify that there is a risk of the appearance of false jobs, generated by the relocation of the workers of a neighbour operator to a new operator.
Therefore, a balance must be found between competitive economic policies and social policies.
It is also necessary to discourage any distortion of competition.
First of all, this can be done by transparency, as well as by preventing the creation of a monopolist alliance at the level of big railway operators that could block the access of new operators to the market because, in the end, the passengers are the ones who suffer.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers, whose contributions illustrate the extent of this shared desire to develop the use of our railways significantly.
For the benefit of Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Savary, I would add that the Commission has undertaken to present a report 30 months after the directive has been adopted, with, if necessary, legislative proposals based on the European Railway Agency's recommendations.
With regard to the certification of train drivers, our aim is to create a Europe-wide rail area and so, of course, we want to promote mobility for railway personnel.
Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, all this will work only if the Member States supply the necessary investment because we cannot have a successful railway policy until we make the trans-European networks a reality, and guarantee interoperability on all the major lines, notably through the ERTMS.
Clearly the duty to invest is crucial.
Investment is the price to be paid for giving full effect to the texts that you are about to adopt.
In relation to freight traffic by rail, there was, indeed, an initial proposal for a regulation on compensation for failure to meet commitments on service quality in this sector.
Subsequently, while recognising that the aims were sound, Parliament and the Council decided that the measure proposed was inappropriate.
Nonetheless, I have to say that I will continue to pay close attention to the development of freight traffic on the railways.
I am still concerned about problems of punctuality and the reliability of goods transport services by rail.
So I will submit a report towards the end of 2007 on the development of service quality and on suitable measures to tackle the problems.
This will obviously lead the Commission to propose a European railway network with a focus on freight.
I hope to present the report in October.
As many of you have said, any compromise is clearly just a step and may be seen to be limited, but a step can also be seen as a measure of progress.
For my own part, I am convinced that by adopting this third Railway Package, Parliament will send out a powerful signal to the people of Europe, who can make much greater use of rail as a means of travel.
I would add that we are in the process of establishing passengers' rights, based on the notion of European citizenship.
With regard to aircraft passengers, much remains to be done in order to give effect to the law.
In the case of rail passengers, they obviously need to be supplied with clear, straightforward information enabling them to understand what they are entitled to expect.
I believe, however, that we are effectively sending out a strong signal by demonstrating that we are determined to press ahead with development of a proper passengers' charter to give everyone - including the least advantaged - greater access to mobility.
Such is my conviction and I would conclude, Mr President, by thanking once again all the Members of the House, whose observations will assist us in the process of closely monitoring how these texts are applied.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 25 September 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council have managed to reach agreement on the third Railway Package.
With regard to my colleague Dirk Sterckx's report, it is a particular source of satisfaction that we got the Council to accept that passengers' rights and obligations should apply to everyone travelling by train in the European Union, and not just to international passengers.
All rail passengers are now to have significant rights, concerning, for example, compensation in the event of delays or cancellations, the information that is supplied to them, and access for people with reduced mobility.
With regard to Georg Jarzembowski's report, opening the international rail passenger market to competition from 1 January 2010 ought to make rail a more efficient means of transport and to have a positive impact for passengers, in terms of prices and choice of train operators.
In addition, it will be possible to finance loss-making railway lines if they have a public-service remit.
This measure is important for guaranteeing universal access to rail transport.
The provisions introduced in this third Railway Package represent genuine progress for ordinary people, and I welcome them.
in writing. - (FR) I am very pleased that the approach I had advocated has been taken, namely opening passenger services to competition, but without rushing.
The third Railway Package provides for liberalisation of international passenger services from 2010 onwards, with a viable mechanism for financing infrastructure.
After the Commission delivers its findings on the economic, social and safety-related aspects in 2012, we can consider calmly whether it is appropriate to extend the existing arrangements to include national passenger services.
We were keen that these measures to modernise the management of rail services should be balanced by significant steps to ensure safety.
Train staff will now have to meet common standards of qualification and training, leading to the award of a 'train driver's licence'.
Parliament has also secured a significant improvement in passengers' basic rights on both international and national lines: there are provisions for liability in the event of accidents, and rights for people with disabilities or reduced mobility.
I am sorry to see, however, that intractability in the Council has resulted in derogations being permitted for up to 15 years with regard to implementation of the right to information, compensation in the event of delays or accidents and, indeed, provision for carrying bicycles on trains.
in writing. - (HU) One hundred and sixty years ago, in 1846, the first Hungarian railway line was opened between the old city of Pest and the town of Vác.
Hungary's first railway line preceded the French bourgeois revolution of 1848 by two years, and more or less the same people were behind both events.
This was hardly coincidental.
The railway fostered the rise of the middle classes, economic development, disintegration of feudal restrictions and the birth of unified nations.
In the second half of the twentieth century, motorisation eclipsed the development of the railways in Hungary too.
Fortunately, however, this was only a temporary decline.
The Hungarian railway is in rather a bad state at present, and this is one reason why it is important to apply for Community funds to develop it.
Development of international transit rail networks is understandably a priority.
Similarly, the importance of suburban railways has increased.
At least half a million people commute to Budapest daily for work or study.
The only solution to the chronic traffic jams is to introduce congestion charges and focus resources on developing the suburban railway.
Liberalisation is to be welcomed as long as it does not threaten railway employees' jobs or the safety of railway operations.
It is likewise important to ensure that passengers' rights are protected by sound guarantees.
I hope that, under the new system, with the help of government and EU funds and private capital, the Hungarian railway will once again become as modern as it was in the early days, in the era of great reforms.

Decision on urgent procedure
Proposal for a Council Regulation derogating from Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, as regards set aside for year 2008 - C6-0302/2007 -
Mr President, yesterday my committee had an extraordinary meeting in order to examine the Commission proposal and the request to treat this proposal as urgent.
My committee agreed that the request for urgent procedure should be approved.
It was approved unanimously.
The Commission is proposing to set a 0% rate of compulsory set-aside for 2008.
This proposal must be adopted as soon as possible - that is, before the end of this month - in order to allow farmers to take their decisions for growing crops on set-aside land in 2008.
The land concerned must be brought back to production because a poor 2008 harvest combined with 10% set-aside will expose the internal market to potential serious risks.
The cereal market at the beginning of the marketing year 2007/08 is characterised by historically high prices both at Community and world level.
The 2007 harvest will probably remain close to last year's level and will lead to further reductions in the EU of private cereal stocks by the end of the 2007/08 marketing year.
At global level, closing stocks in 2007/08 are expected to fall to an historically low level, especially in major exporting countries.
In this context, a normal 2008 harvest will trend yields, and the proposed derogation for set-aside in 2008 in the European Union would allow for a partial rebuilding of the private stocks, so I ask for urgency.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
(DE) Mr President, I refer to yesterday's plenary session and the one-minute speeches that took place at the start of the plenary session.
During those one-minute speeches there was an incident.
A Polish Member (I do not know which Group he belongs to) criticised our President in an improper manner in this House.
I defended the President of our House, as I thought was necessary.
I had the impression that many colleagues in this House saw things the way I did.
As a result my fellow Member, Markus Ferber, later threw a comment in my direction, the gist of which meant that I assume the right in this House to make comments on everything, which is definitely not the case.
I regret that I do not have the right to do this, but I do not comment on everything.
As a result I insulted Mr Ferber in the generally fevered situation with two German expressions, which I would not like to repeat here and which are not true either.
I therefore take it back, expressing my regret and would be grateful if you would convey to my fellow Member, Mr Ferber, that he should accept my apology and that I otherwise regard him as a very amusing fellow Member.
(Applause)
Mr Schulz, we shall include your comments in the record of proceedings and take note of them.
Restructuring of the sugar industry - Common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Katerina Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the restructuring of the sugar industry - C6-0176/2007 -, and
the report by Katerina Batzeli, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector - C6-0177/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Ms Batzeli and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on this proposal.
I will now start to place the proposal into its context.
As you know, the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations during the second year of the restructuring period, after actually quite a promising first year.
As you might remember, we were expecting about 1.5 million tonnes of quota to be renounced in the first year and more than 3 million tonnes in the second year.
In reality, the total renunciation in the first two years amounted to only 2.2 million tonnes against an expected 4.5 million tonnes.
I am still convinced that the restructuring fund is a good instrument as such, which should be strengthened and improved, taking into account the experiences that we have had up to now.
Concerning the proposal we are to discuss today, let me make it clear that we are not in a process of renegotiating the sugar reform from 2005.
In light of the insufficient take-up under the restructuring fund over the first two years of its operation, the objective is to make a success out of it for the last two years.
Otherwise the final uncompensated cut of the quotas will kick in in 2010.
This proposal aims to make a very attractive offer to those undertakings and to those growers that want to give up quota production in the marketing year 2008/09, while in principle keeping unchanged the conditions for the last year of the restructuring period.
For the first time, growers will be able to trigger the restructuring process, but only up to a limit of 10% of the quota belonging to an undertaking.
The percentage of the restructuring aid reserved for growers will be fixed at 10% and this payment will be then supplemented by a top-up of EUR 237.5 per tonne of sugar quota and this sums up altogether to EUR 300 per tonne.
I think this is a very interesting offer for the growers and I do not see any need to go further.
That is why I will not be in a position to support the amendments in the report on the restructuring fund that asks for changes in the amounts paid, for example 6, 7 and 12, or in the percentage that goes to the farmers: namely, amendment 8.
An element of retroactivity will ensure that those undertakings and those sugar beet producers who have already taken part in the restructuring scheme up till now have not been or will not be disadvantaged by having done so.
As requested in amendment 9, the eligibility of inulin syrup producers and chicory growers for retroactive payments will be explicitly mentioned in the final text.
Moreover, undertakings that will be restructured in the marketing or growing year 2008/09 could be exempted from the restructuring levy applied to the quantity subject to the 2007/08 preventive withdrawal, provided that they renounce their quota accordingly.
And, last but not least, as an additional incentive for undertakings, their individual restructuring effort will be taken into account in case of an obligatory final quota cut.
In order to make it easier to reach a market balance during the restructuring period, it is proposed to make the preventive withdrawal a permanent tool, not only during the restructuring period, exactly as is proposed by Ms Batzeli in her report.
The proposed draft regulations aim to create a secure environment and to remove existing blockages from the system.
All these improvements should make the fund a success in the third year, without changing the common market organisation for sugar on the basis of the reform that we agreed in 2005.
The measures proposed are balanced to create strong incentives for all parties that are involved in the restructuring process.
I want to thank you for your good cooperation, which makes it possible for us to adhere to the tight schedule that we have to work under and to have this much more efficient system in place for the marketing year 2008/09.
I am aware that the fund must be improved to achieve its aim and, if this is not possible, I am quite sure that there will be no winners.
There will only be losers and, therefore, I have been very grateful for the support that I have met from the Agriculture Committee and the Members.
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, allow me first of all to remind you that in its original opinion on the Common Market Organisation (CMO) in sugar the European Parliament pointed out that the Commission's proposals ought to contribute to the essential viability of the new system and to the safeguarding of the sugar beet growers, the workers in sugar mills and areas of production, all of which will be affected by the elimination of quotas.
This was our political commitment and agreement, based on which we gave our consent to the Commission.
However, the final decisions by the Council in 2005 on the review of the sugar sector could not meet these high expectations.
The sector is particularly important for the equalisation of the arable crops market, the supply of European sugar and bio-ethanol factories, as well as the advancement of a new framework of policies for the modification of other CMOs under review within the context of the new CAP. The Council's decisions have seemed doomed from the outset to a short life and marginalisation because they were no more than a patchwork of national demands and complex mechanisms.
This decision and the way it is implemented at national level mean that the reduction in production to date has been no more than 2.2 million tonnes, whereas the target is approximately 6 million tonnes by 2010.
I should like remind you that for any kind of reduced production after 2010 the producing regions, workers and producers will not receive any compensation from the Restructuring Fund, which is totally self-funded.
Such, then, were the important political issues occupying us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when we had to decide on the report with which you are acquainted.
Commissioner, in the Agriculture Committee we made significant improvements for the unimpeded implementation at national level of Community decisions.
We did not seek radically to review the sugar CMO, and, in any case, you indicate this in your text.
We did not seek to propose a multi-speed review since in many regions such as Ireland sugar production has already been reduced in part or totally abandoned.
In addition, we have considered the existing budgetary savings amounting to approximately EUR 3 million.
If this money is not used, it will not be ploughed back into the sector but will fund other projects or will be paid back.
Finally, in light of the principle of proportionality and equality with regard to sugar beet growers, we must all agree with the principle of the retroactivity of the measures proposed in order not to create a climate of injustice for producers, mills and regions that have already joined the new system.
I should also like to point out that the ineffectiveness of the large degree of the Member States' flexibility and subsidiarity worries us.
This flexibility has become an unofficial nationalisation of the measures: the Member States have been free to implement the new CMO as they please, bending to the pressures exerted on them by collective bodies and regional authorities.
The way the Member States treat the concept and policy of flexibility ought to be a matter of concern for us in future reviews, as should the issue of how this policy is to be used within the framework of health check decisions.
Commissioner, we must now move from political questions to technical issues, which will also decide the course of the CMO review.
With regard to the amendment of Regulation No 318/2006, we consider that what is required is a fairer application of the final linear quota reductions by 2010.
If a straight reduction in quotas is considered necessary in 2010, our committee believes that this reduction should be conducted in two stages.
During the first stage there should be a linear cut of 13.5%.
During the second stage the Commission's proposal should be implemented; accordingly, the Member States and those undertakings which have renounced quotas during the restructuring regime would be exempted.
The exemption will be in line with the efforts made at national level.
However, I should like to point out to the Commission and the Council, not attending the debate here today, that we must bear in mind the reduced contribution of undertakings, which have either voluntarily reduced their quotas by participating in the restructuring regime or participated in the preventative withdrawal mechanism.
We propose a broader and more long-term use of preventative withdrawal, thus assisting smoother adaptation of the sector to future challenges.
Since the subject of preventative withdrawal has hitherto not been found in the compromise at Council level, I should like to include it, Commissioner, if you agree.
As for the amendment of Regulation No 320/2006 on the restructuring regime, which is in any case the central aspect of the reform, my report proposes:
firstly, to increase to EUR 260 per tonne the lump sum of EUR 237 per tonne which the producers will receive.
We insist on this, despite your disagreement, Commissioner, because we believe that it is a significant incentive for producers to move to the concept of a 10% voluntary renunciation;
secondly, to increase to 50% the single compensation amount for producers from restructuring aid, which is currently fixed at 10%.
This increase is a political commitment by the European Parliament; it shows that the subsidies ought to go mainly to the producers.
The message more political than financial;
thirdly, the compensation paid to undertakings for the production of bio-ethanol should be raised from 35% to 100%, since, in our view, a significant incentive should be given to contribute to the renewable energy sources sector;
fourthly, and of particular importance for the regions, is the maintenance of aid for diversification in the regions where mills have closed: it should remain at EUR 109.5 per tonne of reduced sugar production until the 2009-2010 period.
Commissioner, we seek partly to improve funding in order to reduce the impact on the regions as well as to provide additional incentives.
The review is intended not to amend some general provisions but to strengthen incentives;
fifthly, the renunciation of 10% of quotas should apply first of all to small or less competitive producers;
sixthly, restructuring aid must be increased for partial abandonment, from EUR 218.75 to EUR 625 for the 2008-2009 period.
I have to admit that the rapporteur's position is particularly significant in supporting issues of this sort.
I should like to point out as rapporteur that certain proposals of the Agriculture Committee ought to be re-examined to get things in proportion.
For this reason, I believe we ought to take into account funding from the Restructuring Fund and also additional funding from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.
As rapporteur, I should therefore, like to endorse Amendments 27 to 30, which introduce three fundamental principles:
firstly, a retroactive measure, because producers, undertakings and regions which have complied progressively from the start of the new CMO cannot be penalised;
secondly, the amount of aid must be reasonable and acceptable to all sides (and not EUR 625 for one year);
thirdly, it is important to increase retroactively and until the end of the transitional period the amount of aid given to mills for partial abandonment of production.
In closing, allow me to express a note of warning.
Negotiations the Commission is holding with the ACP countries within the framework of the EPA are ongoing.
The Commission seems ready to abolish both the safety clauses with regard to the total quantities of sugar importable into the Community by each partner country and the minimum price clause for imported sugar.
In addition, it is also proposed that access to the Community market should be liberalised in a similar way for the sixteen Sugar Protocol countries.
Commissioner, I believe that we are called upon to do important work here.
Such decisions outside the institutional framework should be invalid: they would invalidate the political and institutional role played by the European Parliament.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President.
The Committee on Budgets fundamentally supports the proposal.
Let me also personally congratulate the rapporteur.
It is a very difficult task under any circumstances to try to persuade growers in a given sector to cut back their production.
Nor does it cast us in a very good light in the eyes of European citizens to be giving support and funding to this sort of thing.
Nevertheless, if it becomes necessary to intervene in such a way and, moreover, it has no greater impact on the overall budget of the European Union than the present arrangements, then it is appropriate that it should be better targeted and that some compensation and support should go to those who are genuinely taking action on this issue on the production side, as is happening in the present case.
It is a major problem, however, that there are cases where countries have already renounced some of their quotas, only to find that the regulations have subsequently changed.
The report proposes ways of resolving this and I ask Parliament to support these in this form.
Thank you for your kind attention.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give a brief review of the last reform.
Many sugar beet growers are asking why a reform of this market regulation, which has stood the test of time over decades, is necessary at all.
There are two main reasons why this reform was and is necessary.
Firstly, it was decided a few years ago, in the wake of the arms initiative, that as from 2009 everything except arms may be supplied to Europe from the poorest countries.
The sugar sector is also affected by this.
The second reason is that there is a WTO decision and we have to remove surpluses.
This means that we have to take more than 6 million tonnes of sugar out of production.
Commissioner, we put forward proposals to Parliament in 2005 and you have just said that the restructuring fund did not fulfil our expectations.
Today I would like to say here that if the Commission and Council had followed Parliament's proposals more closely in 2005, greater volumes of sugar would probably have been renounced voluntarily.
We now have the opportunity to make corrections so that incentives are improved.
I can only ask the Commission and Council to follow the proposals.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, for the report she has submitted.
The Agriculture Committee has largely followed these proposals - with minor corrections - and I am convinced that if the Commission follows these proposals, incentives will be increased to such an extent that much larger volumes of sugar will be renounced voluntarily.
I should like to state, Commissioner, that there are many members of the Agriculture Committee who have listened closely to the sugar beet producers.
If the requirements set out here are met, I believe that this reform will be successful.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Mrs Fischer Boel, I think Katerina Batzeli's report and Surján László's opinion are technically sound and politically very correct.
Restoring balance in the market is important, and we are still a long way from being able to achieve a market balance by 2010 with regard to European sugar production and sugar beet cultivation.
I do not envy the Commission or Parliament, because it is not easy to create order and equilibrium in a distorted, excessively complicated and oversubsidised system.
This sector, after all, was the beloved child of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) compared to other, less favoured sectors.
I fully agree on the need for counterbalancing.
If we implement the additional 10% reduction, there will still be a surplus of 2.1 million tonnes in the system, and if we do not manage to deal with this by 2010 we will need to make a further reduction of 14%.
I believe it is unfair, and I would ask the Commissioner and the Commission to weigh this carefully, that those countries which have made major reductions, namely Italy, Portugal and Finland, will still have to make a further reduction of 10% along with all the others.
This is not fair.
I also agree that we should do more to protect the interests of small and medium-sized growers, because the 'first-come-first-served' rule puts them at an informational disadvantage compared with the multinationals.
In Hungary one factory in five has closed down.
The best sugar manufacturer has ceased operating, but neither the manufacturer nor the growers have come off badly.
The only thing not covered adequately in the earlier regulation was compensation to employees, I mean compensation to the employees of the sugar manufacturer.
Lastly, I think it is very important that undertakings should not have to pay the restructuring levy if they reduce their quota.
There is a demand to this effect.
I ask Mrs Fischer Boel to support this, as it would encourage further reductions and help restore a balance in the market.
Once again, helping small and medium-sized growers is therefore very important because this has a major social impact on European sugar beet growers.
Thank you for your attention.
on behalf of the UEN group. - (PL) Mr President, the reform of the sugar production sector in its existing shape is unacceptable.
It strikes primarily at beet producers and sugar factory workers.
The exceptional activity shown by European concerns in buying up sugar factories in Eastern Europe prior to their accession to the EU gives rise to the suspicion that this reform was already being planned back then, with vast sums in compensation for the owners of sugar factories who will be shutting them down.
In the new Member States, during the accession period farmers invested huge sums in upgrading their farms, including beet production.
Two years on it has turned out that production needs to be restricted, while the main beneficiary of the compensation for giving up sugar production will be the new owners of the sugar factories.
It is estimated that in Poland alone around ten factories will be closed.
The proposed adjustments, which allocate higher sums from the restructuring fund to growers, are good.
My doubts, though, arise from the support for producers who have been buying sugar factories over the last few years, because could it not just be that they have been buying them with a view to closing them profitably?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the sugar market regulation is not a showpiece of the Commission and Council!
Mr Deß has already said that if you had listened a little more to Parliament's proposals, some of the glitches would not have occurred.
When we have an instrument like the quota, we must use it and not threaten it for 2010, and then we must make flat-rate or staggered reductions and provide compensation for these.
Your way of doing this through pricing came to grief because you then increased the quota by a million tonnes in one go by converting C sugar into quota sugar.
Furthermore, financing by consumers by means of pricing has meant that the sugar industry has had no interest in restructuring.
Export subsidies have not been radically reduced.
This too would have been required.
The errors should be specified and they are not being corrected now either.
The restructuring fund and restructuring aid are essentially discontinuations.
The regions, trade unions and growers are against them.
No diversification has been adopted, as Parliament demanded, in order to safeguard the regions' socio-ecological development.
Nor are all these errors now being corrected.
We are therefore remedying the wrong symptoms.
Another important point is that you now want to limit restructuring aid going to growers to 10%.
It used to be that countries could fix a higher price.
We are putting forward another proposal here and I hope that Parliament will implement it this time with the referral instrument, because you have not honoured the promises you made to us at the last vote, but have now gone back on them.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, the new sugar sector regulation adopted in 2006 and already being implemented is a bitter pill and it has claimed its first victims.
We, of course, voted against it and were right to do so: sugar mills have closed and many sugar beet growers have ended up unemployed.
They receive paltry compensation which is intended to stifle their opposition and protests.
In my country, Greece, sugar beet cultivation used to guarantee that the people were self-sufficient in sugar; it provided many workers and farmers with work and injected economic life into neglected regions.
Today, two out of five factories have closed, production has fallen by 50%, unemployment in the sector has risen, farmers have been made destitute and whole regions have been devastated.
The amendments proposed today are aimed at fully implementing the new regulation.
There is to be no let up in the diminishing rate of production, fixed at a shortfall of 2.2 million tonnes and increasing to a planned shortfall of 6 million tonnes.
This means an even greater impact than we have already seen.
The winners will be the food industrialists, who will import cheap sugar; the losers will be sugar industry workers, since more mills will close and further numbers of small and medium-sized sugar beet producers will be wiped out.
We oppose this and we will vote against the additional arrangements: they are hastening the completion of the basic regulation and are yet another criminal ploy in the campaign against the European sugar industry and its workers.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, the European sugar industry is on life-support.
The respirator, now the EU, each year gives millions of euros in direct aid and intervention to European sugar growers.
EU taxpayers are financing an antiquated system which has seen its day.
Unfortunately the Committee's proposals mean higher costs and a slower rate of reform, the direct opposite of adjustment to the market which this uncompetitive sector so badly needs.
Sugar-producing countries outside the EU must be given access to the internal market without restrictions.
International trade based on fairer conditions is a means for less developed countries to compete on the global market.
Liberalisation of the sugar industry would also benefit European consumers.
They would avoid having to finance an artificial system of support for producers through their taxes, and they would see lower prices in the shops.
This would benefit everyone.
Mr President, Commissioner, the common market organisation for sugar worked.
It was cheap and offered access to our market to ACP countries.
However, during the WTO negotiations, Thailand, Australia and particularly Brazil insisted on a sugar monopoly.
At the same time, to win allies during the Doha Round, Pascal Lamy, who was at the time European Commissioner for Trade, offered to abolish customs duty for the 49 least developed countries with the 'Everything but arms' programme.
In 2009-2010, Europe will begin to see imports of sugar in theory from poor countries, but which was produced with Kuwaiti, Saudi or other capital, in the Sudan or elsewhere.
European beet growers and sugar producers in outermost regions must therefore be sacrificed for the benefit of Brazil and other countries, hence the 2006 reform.
The same applies to cereals and milk.
Soon it will apply to wine.
Our producers will disappear, which in Europe is what we call 'restructuring'.
Of course, we pay cereal growers to stop growing crops: we call it 'restructuring aid', like the set-aside payment or the grubbing-up premium.
However, 18 months after this aid programme began, it is not working.
Commissioner, you are giving us the same old speech about grain mountains and milk lakes.
You are saying that in 2007-2008, there will be a 4 million tonne surplus, hence the two proposals today for a regulation to obtain the abandonment, apparently, of almost 4 million tonnes of sugar.
We are increasing financial incentives and annual withdrawals, and additional payments and subsidies.
Of course, this aid will stop after 2010 and our farmers will be wiped out, just like the ACP producers, not to mention workers.
The only winners will be importers.
These Malthusian policies have been applied to cereals since 1993.
At 9 o'clock, Mr Parish told us that there was a wheat shortage, that prices were rocketing and that set-aside needed to be abandoned.
So there is some hope at least: in 2011, there will be a new regulation telling us that there is a sugar shortage and that we need to start growing it again!
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, as a Member of this Parliament for the Czech Republic where the sugar market has already been restructured, I cannot agree with the proposed changes.
They are inappropriate and unfair.
It is becoming clear that the reform does not result in a series of economically uncompetitive companies.
It produces a disproportionate situation from which only the big European sugar companies profit, with no benefit whatsoever to consumers and growers.
I cannot explain to the citizens how a number of countries have not renounced their sugar quotas at all or have done so only on a very small scale while the rest of us are now supposed to pay them more money for breaking a commitment.
First and foremost, I absolutely do not agree with increasing the aid in cases of partial restructuring to the level of full restructuring aid.
Secondly, increasing the amount of restructuring aid to beet growers and contracted suppliers of machinery from 10% to 50% is totally unjustified.
Thirdly, I do not support an increase of additional payments to producers or any increase of temporary restructuring aid; nor do I support an increase in additional payments to suppliers.
Fourthly, the proposal to treat the dismantling of facilities that took place last year as having taken place this financial year and in the course of the following years is, in my opinion, completely absurd.
On the contrary, ladies and gentlemen, the key issue for me is taking into account the full amount of quotas renounced during the whole restructuring period.
I certainly do not support the move to allow the quotas renounced by companies from the financial year 2008-2009 to be taken into account.
I believe that unless the Commission intends to modify its purely bureaucratic and highly unfair method of managing the sugar reform, the best thing to do would be to abolish sugar quotas as quickly as possible and liberalise the sugar market.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, the EU's sugar policy is in a strange situation.
Sugar quotas have been reduced by 2.2 million tonnes but at the same time the Commission has been selling millions of tonnes of new quotas.
The net reduction is therefore just a million tonnes, whilst the target was six times that figure.
At the same time, the big producer countries have only increased their production.
For example, Germany has increased its production from what was around 240 000 tonnes a year and France from what was 350 000 tonnes a year.
It is primarily just the small countries that have reduced their production.
Of the biggest countries only Italy has reduced its production significantly.
The result of this has been that the small countries and those countries which are poorer off in terms of their natural conditions have had to reduce their sugar production.
At the same time again, more than EUR 3 billion - three thousand million euros - has accumulated in the restructuring fund, of which perhaps around EUR 2 000 remains unspent at present.
This money has mainly come from consumers, because consumer prices have fallen more slowly than producer prices, and this difference has accrued in the Fund.
On the other hand, it has also come from farmers, whose producer prices have gone down.
This money has been and is being paid mainly to the industry, in the form of a massive amount of compensation to the tune of EUR 730 per tonne, while at the same time just around 10%, at best 20%, of this cash goes on changing the industrial structure and tearing down factories.
The entire sugar policy is a warning example of what can happen when we start implementing agricultural policy on industry's terms.
The industry is being paid huge amounts in compensation and we are getting very little in return.
It is to be hoped that in the future agricultural policy will be practised as agricultural and not industrial policy.
We should focus special attention on the importance of solidarity.
It should also be taken into consideration because all countries, including those which have reduced their sugar production, still have to pay prices for sugar which are higher than global market prices, although they are simply not allowed to produce it because the industry has decided against it.
In the same way, in the future we will need to ensure that we do not start applying any similar kind of system to other areas of agricultural production.
Mr President, I should like to thank Ms Batzeli very much for her report.
I should also like to thank Mr Deß very much for shadowing this report for the PPE-DE Group.
I think it was Margaret Thatcher who once said 'you can't buck the markets', and the problem with the whole sugar regime is that it is exactly what we have tried to do over the years.
I commend the Commissioner and what she is doing, because it is a very complex situation and one that we need to sort out.
We need to take more sugar out of the system and we need to make Europe much more competitive in sugar production.
The whole thrust of CAP reform now is to give support to farmers for environmental reasons, but also very much to push them in the direction of producing for the market place.
I think that the reform of sugar this year is perhaps going to be easier than in previous years, for the simple reason that we have now seen cereal prices three times what they were last year.
Therefore, some sugar producers will perhaps decide that they will take the money in the restructuring and that they can grow cereals or oilseed rape and they can make a good living from that.
Because, whatever we do with sugar, we have to be sure, as I said, that we move in the direction of reducing the amount produced in Europe - but we must still allow the farmers to have a living from the land.
We also have to consider not only balancing sugar production in the European Union, but the fact that there are ACP countries from which we import sugar.
In my own country, the United Kingdom, Tate & Lyle imports over one million tonnes of sugar.
It is very concerned to make sure that it can get access to this sugar at the same time as we are reducing and reforming the sugar regime.
I would ask the Commissioner to look sympathetically at that side of the argument as well.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, almost two years ago a legislative package was adopted for the reform of the sugar sector, with the aim of adapting it to a globalised market that really left few opportunities for our farmers.
As you well remember, Commissioner, it was a traumatic reform on which it was difficult to reach an agreement in Parliament.
Now it seems that the objectives of reducing quotas are not being achieved; that is why the Commission is putting forward this new proposal aimed at redressing the situation before it is too late.
We think that in principle, the Commission's proposal is positive, as to a certain extent it gives farmers the opportunity to take the initiative to renounce.
However, in certain aspects, Commissioner, we also think that it is inadequate and that it may produce undesirable effects in some countries such as Spain.
I would therefore like to highlight two points that I think are very important.
Firstly, I would like to stress the importance of the amendments tabled by the Socialist Group, and I would like to thank our rapporteur, Katerina Batzeli for her work, on the need, in some cases, to extend additional aid for withdrawal for farmers to the 2009-2010 marketing year.
We think that this change is vital so that the measure does not fall short and the expectations of producers are fulfilled.
Secondly, I would like to draw attention to the amendment that was adopted in committee in my name, which comes to plenary as Amendment 11, on deeming full dismantling to have taken place where facilities have been converted to bioethanol production.
This measure has two purposes: on the one hand, it encourages renunciation, as it gives a way into other markets for these facilities and, on the other hand, it promotes a sector such as biofuels at a time when there is so much talk of the need to increase supply.
Commissioner, this reform has already been traumatic for many countries, such as mine; I think that there should be money and opportunities to maintain income for farmers who wish to renounce, but above all, for farmers who wish to continue.
(PL) Mr President, the reform of the sugar market is one of those reforms whose sense is very hard to explain to farmers in the European Union, including farmers in my country, Poland.
The administrative and financial pressure to cut back sugar production from 18 to 12 million tonnes is not convincingly justified.
There is talk of a need for solidarity with farmers on other continents, though it is clear that this is not about their interests: it is not about farmers' interests so much as the global interests of large concerns.
In the name of these interests, the European Union, under the auspices of successive 'reforms', is gradually disposing of its agriculture and setting forth down the very hazardous road of making itself dependent on food supplies from outside.
This policy is leading to a loss of security in food supplies, a security that is of great importance to future generations.
My fear is that it will not be long before everyone, and not just farmers, will regret these irresponsible reforms which are going on today, the harmful consequences of which we shall all soon recognise.
(PT) As is well known, we are very critical of this reform of the sugar sector.
We always uphold food sovereignty and we therefore think it is unacceptable that a country such as Portugal, with only one sugar factory in Coruche and one small factory in São Miguel, in the Azores, which scarcely managed to supply half the country's consumption needs, should be confronted with the obligation to reduce its quota for sugar produced from sugar beet.
It is clear what the consequences will be: farmers and undertakings will abandon production, thus creating more unemployment and adversely affecting the development of rural areas.
It is therefore essential - as thousands of small and medium-scale farmers asserted on the streets of Porto on 17 September whilst the Agriculture Council was meeting in Portugal - to change policy in order to take account of the specific situation in each Member State and their own production and consumption needs, securing farmers' incomes and the development of rural areas.
That is what we are once again proposing to the Commissioner.
Mr President, before I begin can I remind everyone that it is not a question of beet or grain.
In Ireland, beet was grown in a mutually beneficial rotation with wheat.
Commissioner, sugar restructuring in Ireland was a disaster.
It was handled badly by the company Greencore and our Minister for Agriculture.
Many of my constituents have suffered and social displacement is widespread, which is why the least we can do is go back and compensate these people.
Our hope of having a rational biofuels industry that was integrated, rather than competing with food production, was set back by years, if not destroyed.
When I approached the Commission to try to head off disaster, I was told that the scheme was set and that to tamper with it, even for a good reason, would unravel the whole thing.
But now we are tinkering with the scheme.
Is it not possible at this stage of adjustment to do something about the mess left behind in Ireland?
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Batzeli and Mr Deß, we all know that the proposed amendments to the regulation on the CMO in sugar aim to make participation in the Community sugar industry more attractive under the restructuring regime so as to achieve the target of reducing Community sugar production.
Allow me to make three observations about this.
Firstly, the Commission's approach is positive.
This is particularly the case with its proposal to give even retroactively increased support to beneficiaries who have already complied with Regulation No 318/2006, allowing them to feel that they have not been unjustly treated despite contributing first to the restructuring of the sector;
Secondly, it has been made perfectly clear, I believe, that if the desired reduced level of production is not reached, future measures for a linear reduction will apply only to those Member States which have not made an effort to attain this target.
On the other hand, the regulation will take into account the countries which have made significant reductions and whose industrial units still remaining have now reached critical levels.
It is particularly important for countries such as mine to be certain that this position will not be forgotten when we discuss the future of the CMO in sugar for the post-2010 period;
Thirdly, I should like to raise the matter of bioethanol.
Let us take this opportunity to examine seriously the possibility that perhaps in the end our enthusiasm for bioethanol will evaporate, and maybe many of the factories producing it will not be viable.
What will the future hold for the workers in this industry, and what will happen to the farmers?
Shall we once again have to cope with an army of unemployed?
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Regrettably, the restructuring of the sugar market has not brought the results we had hoped for.
In modifying the restructuring scheme, it must be taken into account that some Member States have renounced a substantial portion of their quota.
Hungary has abandoned 27% of its quota, whilst the average for the European Union as a whole is just 10.5%.
When determining the final quota reductions, therefore, I am in favour of taking into account the scale of production in each Member State.
It would be inappropriate if the same reduction was prescribed for all Member States of the European Union at the same time since production characteristics differ in each country.
Moreover, modification of the restructuring scheme should not impact negatively on Member States that have already implemented a higher-than-average quota reduction.
For this reason I oppose taking beet and isoglucose quotas together when calculating the ratio of the quota renounced to the initial quota.
Meanwhile, the maximum amount of restructuring aid should also be granted in instances where facilities are not dismantled but converted to alternative uses such as biomass or bioethanol production.
Thank you for your attention.
(PL) Mr President, the fact that, as part of the reform of the sugar market, sugar supply has fallen by 0.2 million tonnes in the last two years, an amount that differs considerably from the proposed level, should come as no surprise to anyone.
This outcome was foreseen by Polish MEPs, as witnessed by our speeches both before the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in the plenary of the European Parliament.
The failure to achieve the intended aims indicates that adequate motivation and incentives, including opportunities for beet growers to take up other production, were not put in place.
This was acknowledged by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when they proposed, among other things, raising the amount of aid set aside for growers and entities providing services from 10% to 50% of the aid allocated to a sugar factory business, and raising the extra payment for growers for the marketing year 2008-2009 from EUR 237.50 to EUR 260 per tonne of the quota which was being renounced.
It also needs pointing out that the Commission is currently not implementing the principles of the reform, the aim of which is to maintain production in the most competitive regions.
The proposed changes do nothing to counter the problems, let alone resolve them; they are making the situation worse.
(ES) Madam President, thank you very much to the Commissioner for being here.
I think that the Commissioner, the rapporteur and many of the speakers have highlighted the problems that there have been with implementing the 2005 sugar reform, and the fact that abandonment of production has suffered delays leaving it far short of the objective of 6 million tonnes provided for in the reform.
I therefore believe that we all welcome the proposal that the Commission is now putting forward, which will give a new impetus to abandonment.
The sector, too, mainly the beet production sector, is very pleased that the restructuring process is being speeded up given that, as the Commissioner also said, otherwise there will be an across-the-board cut in quotas in 2010, with no aid funds to compensate for those cuts.
I think that the amendment I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in line with this philosophy and this new proposal.
I am referring to Amendment 31, which calls for a report evaluating the reform and, if necessary, proposals to extend this aid fund by one year during the 2010-2011 marketing year.
It was initially planned for a period of four years, to compensate, as I said, for this initial delay in implementing the reform.
This is something that has been called for by producers, and I think that it should be supported, especially given that the fund is financed solely by the sector, and therefore has no financial impact on the Community budget.
I ask, Commissioner, for this amendment to be approved by the Commission, and of course also my fellow Members.
Finally, I would just like to thank Mrs Batzelli for her work, her reports, and the improvements she has proposed, with the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture, and for the proposal presented by the Commission.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that far-reaching reforms are needed in the sugar industry in the European Union to enable it to remain successful in the future.
Reducing production is an essential component of these reforms.
However, this reduction should focus primarily on companies that are uncompetitive; unfortunately, the reality is often different.
For example, in my home country, the Czech Republic, the sugar factories that were new, effective and prosperous were closed and quotas were renounced on behalf of supranational producers.
Of course this had a very negative impact on domestic growers and consumers.
I would therefore like to appeal to the Commission to take competitiveness principles into account, to a greater extent than before, when implementing the necessary reforms in the sugar industry, and to pay much more attention to the development of the biofuels sector.
I think that biofuels offer new opportunities to sugar beet growers and represent the future.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the reform of the sugar market which was begun in 2005 is not achieving the anticipated results, despite huge financial outlay.
Despite large financial incentives, amounting to EUR 730 per tonne of reduction in sugar production, in the Community as a whole sugar production has fallen by barely 1.1 million tonnes, instead of the anticipated 6 million.
The next set of changes to the functioning of the sugar market proposed by the Commission are not only failing to improve the situation, they are actually making it worse, as they are not consistent with the main principle of the reform, in other words sustaining sugar production in the most competitive regions.
What I think is needed is, firstly, to create conditions for stable development for the most competitive sugar producers in the Community, to enable EU production to compete on an increasingly open world market.
Secondly, we need to draw maximum advantage from sugar's export potential within the framework of the limit agreed with the World Trade Organisation.
And finally, thirdly, if these solutions fail to produce a marked improvement in the sugar market, it will be necessary to reduce production, but using a linear factor that is the same for all Member States.
(CS) Madam President, I represent a country that invented the sugar cube.
High-quality sugar was something we used to be proud of but the European Union ruthlessly took this pride away from us.
If Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 is implemented, the Czech Republic will be penalised for its appropriate behaviour towards foreign investors from the original EU countries that it has allowed to take over the sugar industry in the country.
This Regulation is an inappropriate attempt to satisfy the interests of the big European sugar refining companies, while the interests of the countries that are the traditional growers and producers are being ignored.
It is therefore necessary, as the amendment by Mr Fajmon and others suggests, to enable Member States to scrap provisions a) and b) and leave it to the individual Member States to determine how to deal with the critical situation that would arise if the quota fell by 20% or more.
Otherwise, the Czech Republic might, absurdly, become an importer of the traditional product it has been making for centuries.
One day, when our grandchildren are making a list of reasons why the Czech Republic should leave the European Union, the sugar policy and the regulations we are now debating will be at the top of the list.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, I understand very well that sugar quotas need to be cut further and I am in favour of it.
I also understand, in the light of the figures we have, that the previous reform did not succeed.
This issue, however, is how this future reform is to be implemented.
It should be fair to all Member States, and if we consider it from the viewpoint of my country, Finland, for example, there were two sugar factories in the country, and the previous cut in quotas, a reduction in practice of 40%, led to one of them shutting down.
If there were to be another cut of 13% under this reform, that would mean in the worst case scenario that all sugar production would end in Finland, because both factories would have had to close.
This is obviously an unfair situation for Finnish sugar growers and Finnish industry.
That is why I support the amendment which my colleague, Mr Fajmon, has tabled and which states that this proposal should not apply in any way to Member States whose quotas have already been cut by more than 20% unless they themselves then decide otherwise.
I would hope that the Commissioner also understands the situation small countries are in.
In Finland, while we are now discussing the subject of cuts in aid to the south of the country under Article 141 of the Accession Treaty, the rural population's belief in the European Union is very weak.
There needs to be some glimmer of hope, and above all these reforms have to be carried out fairly, so that all Member States get treated the same way.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank all of you for all your valuable comments.
I think that we see the complexity of this issue from the comments delivered here today.
I would just like to make a few comments.
First of all, I am convinced that what is now proposed - which I would describe as a big carrot for the sector - will work.
The carrot is quite attractive because we now give farmers the possibility of getting 10% of the restructuring fund, and the restructuring fund for the year 2008/09 is EUR 625.
EUR 62.5 plus the top-up that we pay from the restructuring money - EUR 237.5 - comes to EUR 300 per tonne that the farmers send back to the Commission.
What I consider the most important thing is that, for the first time, farmers can trigger the restructuring fund.
This has not been possible before.
Previously it was only the industry.
Now farmers can say 'I want to leave and I want my EUR 300 per tonne, and I get the compensation for the reduction in prices on top of that'.
And that is not a one-off payment: that continues.
I completely agree with Mr Parish.
I think that the alternative to sugar beet production is much more attractive now than it has been for decades, with the cereal prices, with the oil-seed prices.
Therefore, I presume that farmers will make their calculations and look at the bottom line of the most attractive way of arranging their future production.
I mentioned retroactivity the first time that I spoke.
Retroactivity is there so that those who have delivered from the very beginning will not be punished; they will be compensated.
It is for beet growers, for inulin syrup producers and for chicory growers.
So there is no difference between the various types of beet production.
So I am confident, and I am very thankful for the quick reaction from Parliament, which I hope will allow us to find a political agreement in the Council tomorrow so we can send a clear signal to the sector, to the beet growers, so they can start planning their next production season.
I am quite sure that this will be to the benefit of the whole sector because, as was also mentioned here today, the alternative to not using this possibility will be a linear cut with no compensation.
So I am quite sure that lots of calculations will take place on the various farms and areas where this may be attractive, to deliver the tonnes that we need to find the right balance in our sugar sector.
Once again, thank you very much - especially to the rapporteur, Ms Batzeli - for all the work done on this difficult dossier.
The debate is closed.
The voting will take place today.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (HU) Madam President, in its current review of the sugar reforms, the European Commission is requiring European farmers and the European sugar industry to make yet further unreasonable sacrifices in the name of restoring a balance in the sugar market.
In my opinion on the European Parliament's report drafted on behalf of the Committee on International Trade some time ago, I pointed out that it would not be possible to achieve the desired balance in the European sugar market as long as there is no legislation providing for effective import protection.
In its report, the European Parliament also put forward proposals to the European Commission and the Council of Agriculture Ministers to limit imports of sugar from third countries.
In the end the legislature did not incorporate these proposals into the final document.
I agree with the tabled amendment to the present proposal suggesting that Member States that have already renounced at least 20% of their quota should not have to implement further quota reductions.
This would be equitable and just towards countries that have already made a serious effort to implement the sugar reforms.
At the same time, however, I think it is important that a review of the sugar reforms should also include measures to make the sugar industry more competitive.
With this in mind, I have tabled an amendment giving Member States discretion to decide first to make it possible for smaller, less competitive sugar beet growers to renounce the right to transport beet.
This is a significant advantage for smaller, less well-informed growers, but at the same time it will help the European sugar industry to become more competitive internationally too.
in writing. - It is regrettable that the Commission has returned within such a short period of time with a second sugar restructuring package for Parliament to vote on.
The initial package resulted in the demise of the Irish sugar industry, to the detriment of the country, farmers and growers.
Unfortunately, to date the compensation package has not filtered fully down to either farmers or contractors.
I disagree with the Commission's attempt to limit the compensation paid to growers and contractors to just 10% in the current package - allocating the remaining 90% to processors seems excessive.
In the initial restructuring scheme a minimum of 10% was allocated to growers and contractors, with Member States being given the flexibility to decide on the precise share out but with this package the Commission is very fixed in how compensation should be allocated.
It is clear that increased levels of restructuring aid are needed to reach the Commissions targets.
I welcome that increased level of restructuring aid will be paid to those who have already quit beet production.
I would urge that the compensation payments due to Irish farmers and contractors be paid out as a matter of urgency - this saga has gone on for too long.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the rules of the common agricultural policy have been being flagrantly violated in many markets in the industry for some time now.
The sugar market is just one more disreputable example of this.
The reform of this market adopted barely two years ago contained unfair solutions for the new Member States, as it gave preference to a few old Member States which generate surpluses in the so-called B quotas that are costly to the taxpayer.
One of the aims of the reform was to improve competitiveness in the sector.
Those who were supposed to remain in the market were those who were most competitive.
The revision that is currently being proposed is aimed at punishing those who are most competitive.
After all, that is what the introduction of new factors and the increased compensation with retroactive effect will achieve.
Is there any logic to be discerned in what is going on here?
When the interests of the old EU are challenged, principles go out of the window.
Solidarity or an equal chance to compete no longer means a thing.
This is true of the entire agricultural sector in which the richer countries get the larger subsidies.
All attempts to do away with discrimination against the poorer new Member States run up against the disarming sincerity of representatives of the older States - you are right, they say, but we are not going to open up 'Pandora's box'.
But now, looking at the sugar sector, the arrangement that was signed up to not very long ago can be changed!
Just because it is affecting the interests of the older Member States and the big concerns.
Dangerous toys manufactured in China (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on dangerous toys manufactured in China.
Two Commissioners will speak.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
Toys are not like any other product. They are designed for the most vulnerable consumer group of all and it is therefore perfectly clear that we must have the highest standards for toys where children's safety is concerned.
A whole range of very grave issues have rightly been raised here in connection with the latest recall campaigns of an American manufacturer, which has recalled faulty products from the market at its own initiative.
First of all I would like to say that both cases concerned here involve products not licensed under European law for the European market.
Toys with lead paint have, of course, been banned in Europe for a long time, unlike in the United States of America.
Toys with magnetic parts or other dangerous parts which could become loose have also been banned, of course, for a long time in Europe.
What we have here, therefore, is not a problem of applicable law (although I will be coming to applicable law, an area in which something has to be changed, later), but it is a problem of the implementation and observance of the applicable law.
Products we deal with every day cannot be one hundred per cent safe.
The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that no defects will occur in production.
The best legislator in the world cannot guarantee that supply chains now organised on a global basis will not encounter a problem at any point.
Nor can the best legislator in the world prevent trade with criminal or fraudulent intent.
I would remind you of the case in which three people died in Greece after using a faulty steam iron.
This iron not only had the European CE marking, but also a specific German safety symbol.
Nevertheless the appliance was not safe, probably because it was counterfeit.
No legislator in the world can do anything to stop this.
That is the responsibility of the manufacturer and it is the responsibility of those who have to ensure that manufacturers comply with the existing rules.
These are the market surveillance authorities of the Member States.
There is no European market surveillance system.
This comes under the sole responsibility of the Member States.
I would like to point out to you that we are in fact having to deal with a problem here that is very closely connected with economic globalisation.
Today this means we have to deal with worldwide supply chains.
We have to deal with companies operating under pressure of costs, meaning that they are constantly putting their suppliers under pressure of costs, thereby contributing to prices constantly being reduced.
There is a very great risk that this will come at the expense of safety at some point.
This is the reason why we are constantly saying that the more international and more extensive the supply chain becomes, the greater the responsibility of companies to ensure that the existing regulations are observed at each individual stage of the supply chain.
This was not the case, for example, in the case of lead paint on toys produced by the American manufacturer.
A Chinese supplier supplied a paint here which it should not have supplied.
These is the truth of the case.
Corporate responsibility is foremost.
Companies are responsible for their product complying with the current European rules.
Then comes the responsibility of the Member States.
They have to ensure that market surveillance works.
And then it is up to us as European legislators.
We have to ensure that our legislation is kept up-to-date and possible risks are identified in good time and incorporated into the legislation.
This is why the Commission began a thorough review of the existing Toy Safety Directive more than two years ago.
The Toy Safety Directive is one of the oldest directives resulting from the 'new approach'. It is clear that the toy market has changed dramatically in the last 20 years and this new directive will therefore pick up on a whole range of recently recognised risks and hazards and will ensure, with very strict rules - on the use of chemical substances in toys, for instance - that dangers are avoided.
The directive will be brought before the legislator by the end of this year.
At the beginning of this year, we had already put before you an entire package of measures for strengthening market surveillance for improving protection of the CE marking.
Let me say something about the CE marking at this point.
The CE marking means that the manufacturer (whether a European manufacturer or a manufacturer outside Europe wanting to sell in Europe) provides an absolute guarantee that its product is fully compliant with the rules in force in Europe.
The manufacturer guarantees this with the CE marking.
That is what the CE marking means.
In a whole range of cases, the manufacturer is not allowed to use the CE symbol on the basis of a self-declaration and his own proof, but must be certified by a third body, namely whenever there may be a risk to users due to the product not working properly.
Certification by a third body is now mandatory in all such cases.
The way these bodies, which we call Conformity Assessment Bodies, operate can be significantly improved.
We have put forward the appropriate proposals and they are available to you as the European legislator.
In relation to toys, a decision now has to be made about a very difficult issue for the Commission and for you as legislator: do we want to move to having each individual toy coming onto the market certified by a third body or do we want to leave it that the manufacturers provide the guarantee by using the CE marking and therefore also assume liability - to which I must also add that the manufacturers have to be able to prove at any time and with full documentation, according to the rules in force today, that they have been using the CE marking lawfully?
Or do we perhaps want to take a third way by defining certain types of toy in the new Toy Safety Directive, where we stipulate certification by a third body?
I do not want to hide the fact that I have great sympathy for this latter solution.
I would like to give you an example: what do we do with all the toys containing chips?
When children put them in their mouths, chips are a dangerous item.
There must therefore be a guarantee that these toy parts can under no circumstances pose a threat to children.
If we do not want to take Game Boys away from children - I do not believe that anyone intends to do this - the only possibility would then be to make certification by a third body mandatory at this point.
The Commission's ideas are along these lines and I also expect to get some impression from this debate of Parliament's thinking on this issue.
The final point I would like to mention is a request to manufacturers and consumer organisations.
Manufacturers need to be aware of the fact that the pressure of costs, as great as it still is, does not absolve them of the responsibility for a full inspection of every individual part of their production process and their supply chain.
The more international production and supply chains become, the greater the responsibility of companies active on the market.
Furthermore, consumer organisations would accomplish a great feat if they were to create an awareness that cheap is not always the same as good.
This is not just a question of safety, but also one of quality, because how often have you seen - even with toys the child opens under the Christmas tree - how a child plays with it just once before it is broken.
It might have been cheap, but it was not good!
Cheap does not always mean good, nor does cheap always mean safe.
This means the consumer needs to be aware that the price of a product has a direct bearing on the quality and safety of a product.
In relation to the low-price ideology, which is spreading in at least some Member States, this is a subject that gives me increasing cause for concern.
I can say in conclusion that European law today is in any case better than what we see in other parts of the world, that it can be improved and is being improved and that wherever toys are involved, the strictest standards of all are being applied and must be applied.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is really an honour and pleasure for me to stand here with Vice-President Verheugen to address Parliament on the critical issue of dangerous products and product safety.
The Commission is united, as you see, in tackling this issue and happy to give you its position from two complementary points of view.
Our open society and our open economy offer citizens choices that were unaffordable and/or unimaginable only a generation ago.
This is major progress, but it comes with a challenge, as we have seen in recent months.
I refer, of course, to concerns about the safety of products and, in particular, children's toys.
Citizens need to know that their safety is underpinned by sound rules, efficient and vigorous authorities and responsible business.
I will start this brief exposé with a few words about law and its enforcement, because it is crucial.
I believe that the current regulatory framework for consumer product safety in the EU is fundamentally sound and will be reinforced by the pending Commission proposal on the New Approach Directives.
I refer in particular to the General Product Safety Directive with its RAPEX system referring to a fundamentally sound framework.
We already have the legal framework to deal with dangerous products made in China or anywhere else.
The challenge of ensuring an internal market of safe goods lies primarily in the effective enforcement of the present legal framework, and, if we read the directive again carefully, this enforcement power belongs to the Member States.
The Member States' market surveillance authorities and customs controls have a duty to ensure that dangerous products are not placed on the market, or are withdrawn or recalled.
The Member States must have in place effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for infringements, and it is written in Article 7 of the General Product Safety Directive that it is really the responsibility of the Member States.
Of course, enforcement by public authorities is only complementary to businesses respecting their legal and ethical obligations, as Commissioner Verheugen stated just minutes ago.
It is the responsibility of manufacturers, importers and distributors to make sure that they place only safe products on the market and take necessary measures where they become aware of a risk to consumer safety.
Just a few words about recent product recalls, which, of course, are our major concern.
On the issue of these recent dangerous product recalls, the Commission would be more worried by silence than by activity, and transparency builds trust.
That is why I can only encourage the national authorities to enhance their surveillance and to inform the Commission about dangerous goods and not just to keep silent for one reason or another, such as not wanting to bother people before Christmas or just trying to tackle the problem in silence.
Of course, questions remain.
Are operators notifying problems sufficiently quickly, and are their internal audits up to scratch?
How can we ensure earlier and more effective intervention by the market surveillance authorities and better monitoring of product recalls?
Nevertheless, the recent recalls have shown that improvements can and should be made on the entire product supply chain, encompassing, amongst other things, product design, suppliers of contractor management, manufacturing process controls and finished product testing.
I would like to talk for a while on relations with China and the United States.
The Commission also questions whether China is doing enough.
During my recent visit to China, my main message was that Europe does not and will not compromise on consumer safety.
I stressed that and obtained the commitment of the Chinese authorities on specific progress targets.
There is no argument from the market which could compete with the safety of products and the safety of people's lives.
I stand prepared to bring them to task should they fail to deliver.
In October, I expect the report from the Chinese authorities, and I am really doing everything possible to assure them that I will not hesitate to take measures if they fail to deliver.
Constructive cooperation with China has already produced results - withdrawn export licences of certain substandard products.
I have to say that I spent four days in China and, within these four days, there were recalls of the licences of the two biggest toy manufacturers.
This puts Europe well ahead in comparison with other developed countries facing similar issues.
As you know, on 16 September, the working group established by the US President issued a report with quite similar measures to those Europe has already taken on board to secure the safety of goods.
We are also in contact with the US consumer product safety authorities and policy makers with a view to mutually reinforcing our messages to the Chinese Government.
I have already talked with the chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), Ms McCarthy, about the results from their visit to the United States.
Next week, when I am in the US, I will check how we could cooperate.
The aim is to give a crystal clear signal to the Chinese.
Adequate safety guarantees will not work as a bargaining chip in relations with one or another economic block; they are a sine qua non for access to either.
I would like to conclude with the next steps which we envisage.
The Commission is committed to making every effort to ensure that toys sold for the Christmas season will not lead to unpleasant surprises, and this commitment is very clear.
Maybe we need a kind of Christmas pact with producers, with importers, with all the authorities in the Member States, which should ensure vigorous implementation, and consumer organisations.
The Commission will update Parliament regularly on developments, in particular on the conclusion of the stocktaking exercise reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of the consumer product safety mechanism currently in place in mid-November, and following the forthcoming EU-China Summit at the end of November.
At the beginning of next month, on the third, there will be a gathering of all the national authorities in Brussels at which we will compare our views on how the directives on safety are implemented everywhere.
We have already had extensive talks with all the toy makers, including Mattel, involving the sharing of practices.
As I recently informed the IMCO Committee, this is no time for knee-jerk reactions.
Together with Vice-President Verheugen and a number of fellow Commissioners, we will ensure the necessary, proportionate and appropriate response to the issues that have surfaced with regard to public confidence in the governance of global product safety.
Although Commissioner Verheugen was really quite exhaustive in his exposé, let me say that as regards revision of the so-called New Approach Package, taking special care of the health and safety of European citizens requires us to preserve the specific and successful system established by the General Product Safety Directive.
By the end of this year, we will produce the first of the reports we are obliged to produce every three years according to the directive, and you will see that this mechanism is really an effective one based on community, solidarity and proportionality.
I am convinced of your view as well in asking to put safety before one-size-fits-all streamlining and to consider favourably the draft regulation as originally proposed by the Commission.
We need also to be aware that this is not happening for the first time.
If you compare how we have been through all the unpleasant events which happen on the market regarding food safety, we can really enhance our institutional comparison and do our best on product safety because in this globalised world we cannot just be an island.
We need to exercise our control and to assure European citizens that the attention from Community authorities is the same everywhere and complements the efforts of the Member States.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, there is a Japanese saying (and I emphasise 'Japanese' rather than 'Chinese' in the context of this question): 'A problem is a mountain of treasures'.
I think Mattel's problem has really focused attention on the important work that we do in this House, particularly my fellow members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on what is traditionally seen as rather a dry subject, one that concerns product regulation, market surveillance and conformity assessment.
Well, the public know why it is important now and I hope they will continue to focus on it.
I want to thank the two Commissioners for coming here today, but perhaps remind them first of all that an oral question was tabled, which they have, I think, anticipated and have covered most of our questions, but I also think we are a bit ahead of them.
You will see the resolution tomorrow that we will vote on, which takes a broad view about product, and particularly toy, safety in the global context.
There are a number of points addressed to both Commissioners.
I am pleased that Commissioner Verheugen has confirmed to us that the Toys Directive will be here towards the end of the year, something that we have been asking for.
I am pleased he has lifted the lid a bit on some of the thinking, but we invite him to perhaps share a bit more of that with us.
We have not been entirely clear which direction he is going in.
He is talking, perhaps, about some differentiated standards for particular areas.
I would merely caution him about that.
I am not entirely convinced, for example, that a toy containing a microchip is any more dangerous than a bicycle, but I let him ponder on that.
Let me just emphasise some of the points that we want to look at.
First of all, the big disappointment this morning is that there is no one from the Council here.
And they have a crucial role to play, as we know, in product conformity and assessment.
Secondly, I agree with the assessment of both Commissioners that the manufacturers and producers have to bear the brunt of the responsibility for managing a supply chain where they do quality checks and they ensure that they are producing consistently high standards of product.
Finally, I think consumers are entitled to more and better information.
I cannot understand why we are so reluctant to tell consumers where products are made.
The Council is sitting on a proposal in selected areas at the moment.
I think that the toy industry must really look seriously at a proper toy safety mark that it develops and manages itself so that consumers really have that assurance that, when they come to buy toys this Christmas, they will have safe, good quality toys.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I think that we in the European Union have to all intents and purposes achieved very high safety standards for products.
I agree with Mr Verheugen when he says that we can never achieve 100% safety, but our aim in Europe must be to have the highest possible level of safety and we have not yet achieved that target.
We still have a great deal to do to make this target a reality.
These recall campaigns (it is not just Mattel, there have also been others in recent months) have shown that there is a very great need for action in the European Union to guarantee that product safety is at the highest possible level.
Three months before Christmas we are, of course, keeping a close eye on toys that need to be especially safe.
Our children are our future; therefore we have to pay particular attention to their safety.
Hence we are already very annoyed that it is taking the European Commission so long to revise the Toys Directive.
I hope that it is true that this directive will have been revised by the end of this year, or even before the end of this year, so that we can actually bring it completely up to date.
I am also very anxious about which proposals will be forthcoming because this has always been very unclear to date.
There is one further point that is quite important, namely the implementation of this law.
The Commissioners have also been addressing it and that, too, is a problem.
On Monday I had the opportunity to go to a certification institute and to have a look and inquire as to what the problems are.
One very clear problem that was highlighted is that the CE marking does not contain what it actually promises.
We need to work on this and hence we are demanding that there should also be additional safety labelling, particularly for toys, so that safety can also be guaranteed.
It is not enough for inspections to be carried out when the products are already in the shops; they must be made beforehand.
We need these inspections beforehand and they must also be compulsory wherever necessary and this is very particularly the case with toys.
A third and final point: the RAPEX system needs to be improved.
When we look at the figures, we see that activity in this area varies considerably from one Member State to the next.
I think that we have to appeal to the Member States here to improve and promote this system so that we are able actually to carry out the necessary product recalls as well as ban products.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I am pleased that there are in fact two commissioners here.
This is evidence of a dynamic approach to the recent problem concerning Mattel.
This problem is of course twofold, which is now also evidenced by the fact that it is less serious when it relates to China, and by the fact that Mattel too has made an error.
As I said, this problem is twofold.
I believe, first of all - and here I would like to reiterate Clinton's words - that politicians must think first and act later.
These were the words of President Clinton during an election meeting last year, during which he also said that we must not immediately become stressed when a button is pushed, as in the case of toys.
I too am guilty of this on occasion.
When something happens, we politicians become stressed and immediately want more stringent measures and stricter regulations.
I believe that we must think first, before we take action.
Fortunately, this is what we did with our resolution.
This brings me to the second item, that is to say why the Mattel problem also has a positive consequence; in particular, we are going to expressly consider the importance of a CE marking, a quality mark that indicates safety, and the way in which we can improve that mark.
I fully agree with what Commissioner Verheugen says about the fact that 100% safety and security can never be achieved; however - following on now from Mrs Gebhardt - we must nevertheless strive to achieve 100% safety.
If a product bears the CE marking, this raises the issue of 100% liability, which is of course of great importance to the consumer.
If the CE marking is present, then the consumer knows that if something should go wrong with the product he or she has purchased, he or she will always have recourse to the manufacturer or importer.
The resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow, Madam President, relates to this matter in particular.
I feel that we have prepared an excellent resolution; the supervision - and here I am in complete agreement with Commissioner Kuneva, who says that we do not need more legislation, but rather that we must regulate existing legislation more effectively and efficiently - is open to improvement.
We cannot leave it to the individual Member States to exercise control in third countries.
I believe that a coordinated European approach in cooperation with the Member States is essential in order to achieve this and I hope that the Commission will make efforts to establish this.
Subsequently, Madam President, it must also be clear to consumers which marks exist.
We have the CE marking and, in the resolution, we are also calling for a toy safety marking, at the very least as a replacement for all existing national markings.
The aim is not to establish a selection of markings, as a result of which the consumer would no longer be able to see the forest for the trees and would therefore no longer be able to make a clear choice, as I feel that by doing so, we would be overshooting the goal.
Things must become clearer, with fewer, but improved regulations.
I believe that this is of the utmost importance.
Subsequently, I hope that we can introduce these markings on a voluntary basis, as the market will enforce it.
If we are going to create obligations, we as an authority must carry out monitoring and I think that the market, the consumer, will opt above all for safety and a clear marking.
If this were to happen, my group and I would be entirely satisfied with the decision.
We look forward to the revision of the Toys Directive, which you have already mentioned.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, inspections and a forest of new symbols - this completely misses the heart of the problem!
Inspections are good, laws are even better!
We do not need more pseudo-safety, or more pseudo-political action for the sake of action, but better laws and better standards.
CMR substances, carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic substances have still not been removed from children's toys.
Toys should not become toxic traps for children.
Poison does not belong in children's hands, even in minute quantities.
Mr Verheugen, I find it intolerable how you absolve your own failure by scolding producers and consumers.
We know that the legal basis, the Toys Directive, has not offered children any protection from toxic toys for years.
The Commission knows this.
You can glean from your own report of 2004 that you get a resounding slap in the face there.
It states in black and white that the Toys Directive has failed.
We have been sending reminders on the revision of the directive since 2001 and they have repeatedly been shelved.
It is not true to say that lead is banned in toys.
Lead per se is simply not banned under the Toys Directive!
Or can the Commission explain to us perhaps why it has not initiated any legal product recall campaign, and why it was a voluntary product recall campaign by the toy manufacturers?
We should no longer therefore be leading the consumer to believe that we have got the problem under control.
We need better protection.
This must quite clearly mean that we have to change the foundation and replace absent standards with clear laws and bans.
It is downright absurd that carcinogenic substances are allowed to get into the hands of children.
Better controls are therefore of no help to us at all here.
Right now, then, we have to tighten up the laws and then carry out better controls.
We should not have our children poisoned while they play!
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, in the debate on the recall of the toys in question it has often been said that responsibility for the fact that dangerous toys are on the market rests with the country of manufacture, in this case China.
I regret that the discussion has not focused more on the responsibility borne by the firms which outsource production to countries such as China, in this case Mattel.
I do not want to single out this particular company for criticism since a great many firms outsource production.
They do so because they want to keep prices as low as possible.
They want to increase profits.
But we must devote much more discussion to the responsibility incumbent on such companies.
They endeavour to keep costs as low as possible while at the same time taking no responsibility either for consumer safety or for the employees who work with these dangerous products.
We must put pressure on companies to make them understand that as consumers we demand safe products that we can trust.
We also demand that products be manufactured in decent working conditions without risks to the health and safety of employees.
It is of course especially tragic when it is children who are hurt by dangerous products.
Clearly we must join together to ensure that this is stopped.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the European Union and China are major mutual trading partners.
This means that China may be called to account for the quality of products supplied.
The European Union cannot resign itself to unsafe clothing or unsafe toys.
The Union should never allow its economic interests in China to take precedence over the interests of the European consumer.
This debate once again shows that the European consumer is served not only with low prices, but much more so with quality and safety, as Commissioner Verheugen also indicated.
This is all the more so, when the safety of children is at issue.
In this debate, I want to look not only at the importers, but most certainly also at the Chinese manufacturers.
Safety does not become an issue only if products reach Europe.
Consideration for safety must form a guiding principle at as early a stage as possible within the production chain.
After all, safety is not a luxury or a nice extra, not here and not in China either.
I call upon the Council and the Commission to convey this message to our Chinese trading partners in a clear and vigorous manner, and Commissioner Kuneva's words in particular give me full confidence that this will in fact be done; I wish her much perseverance in this difficult task.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, China knew and still knows about the dangers of many of its products, not just toys.
China has on many occasions assured us that the vast majority of its exports conform to European standards, but consumers have little faith in Chinese products.
The 2006 Commission report on dangerous products highlights an increase in dangerous infringements, by toys, hairdryers and lighters.
Toys are, in fact, the products with the highest number of irregularities, and China is the country of origin with the most infringements.
Commissioner Kuneva has warned that if China does not respond to the EU's demands, the next step will be to ban the import of some Chinese products.
I believe that we ought to strengthen customs barriers because the EU should protect not only consumers, not only its industry, it should not only support free competition by means of equal market access opportunities, but it should also take action on social and environmental grounds as regards the highly speculative output of Chinese industry.
We need controls not only on the final quality of the product, but also a clear mark of origin and checks, before the distribution of Chinese products is permitted within the internal market, on the safety standards and conditions under which the products are made in their places of origin; otherwise, the institutions will remain complicit in environmental disasters, social exploitation and unfair competition by Chinese industry.
Madam President, it is indisputably right that Mattel should have recalled these dangerous toys.
But a number of pertinent issues arise.
Firstly, for all our consumer protection laws, it was not the EU or any EU agency which picked up on the danger, but rather the parent US manufacturer.
Does that not tell us something important about the efficiency and the reliability of our own protections?
Secondly, we impose on our own indigenous industry, in all spheres, severe standards and demands, ranging from health and safety through to CO2 emission.
Yet we throw open our doors to Chinese goods which are the product of woeful production conditions, fall far short of what we require of our own factories and come from plants which belch out emissions as if there was no tomorrow.
Little wonder we have driven so much manufacturing to the Far East!
But, what I ask is, with what net global gain?
In fairness to both the workers and the consumers of Europe, it is time we brought some sense and order to our approach.
If we had not decimated our own manufacturing industry by punitive regulation, then maybe now we would not be so dependent on China and its shoddy goods.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, the recent recall campaign by a toy manufacturer acted as an alarm bell, and rightly so.
It is now up to us to deal with this problem in a rational and well-considered manner.
If, after many years of effort to achieve a high degree of consumer protection, also with regard to product safety, we are still sometimes confronted with situations in which non-compliant goods are produced, imported and introduced onto the market, that is of course not an ideal situation.
Perhaps, however, it is not entirely possible to prevent this from happening.
Yet despite this, European citizens and European consumers can expect us to continue to deliver maximum effort in order to put a check on this.
In the case constituting the immediate cause for this debate, the products in question are toys from China.
In spite of this, I would like to make an appeal to the effect that we do not restrict ourselves to this - not to the fact that they come from China, because unsafe goods enter the market from other countries too.
In some instances, they are also manufactured by us.
It is better to come to effective agreements than to initiate protectionist campaigns.
Nor must we focus solely upon toys, even though one in four products in which a defect is identified is in fact a toy.
We must ensure that product safety is guaranteed on a general level.
We do not need to devise a new approach as such; rather, we must close the gaps in the existing system.
We are working to achieve this with the proposals from the Internal Market Package for Goods.
I would like to make it clear to everyone that these proposals were drawn up with the aim of enabling the internal market to operate more effectively.
We always incorporate a high degree of protection for the consumer as an objective in these proposals and it now appears that this is actually the case.
The internal market and consumer protection are therefore not conflicting issues, but rather are entirely congruous and this is a path that we must continue to follow.
I have just one question for the Commission, Madam President: in our joint resolution, we are calling for an assessment to be carried out in order to examine whether a voluntary safety marking is available in addition to the CE marking.
I would like to ask the Commissioners what their response to this is.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have been enjoying myself inserting 'toys' and 'China' into Google.
I would recommend you all do this, too.
You will then get entire lists of suppliers, the Chinese supply industry and producers and see all that you can buy there.
80% of the toys from China end up on the Commission's website and vice-versa. The European market imports 80% of its toys from China.
If you look at these two figures together, you can imagine the scope of what we are dealing with here.
Of course, you have to see that on the one hand we are now in a context internationally where the world economy is becoming interlinked and European industry and jobs are naturally dependent on supplies from China.
On the other hand, it must also be said that world-wide networking of this kind in industry only works when there is trust.
This trust is based on certain aspects that also have to be maintained.
Trust grows when there is fair competition.
Fair competition is achieved when there is assurance from the Chinese, and also from the producers and the supply industry, that they are actually able, and have the know-how, to carry out all the necessary checks for exporting their products to Europe according to the criteria of the European market.
However, trust grows, of course, and fair competition can be generated only when the producers, and specifically the Chinese government in this case, guarantee that the environmental, social and worker standards that we have will also be gradually introduced to the same extent by the Chinese, as otherwise we shall have conditions of unfair competition.
Unfair competition always has an impact on this country's ability to make checks.
We can see this because all the data show that most of the problems we have with dangerous toys from China do not necessarily come from producers of the major brands, but from those who are involved in unsafe supply chains.
This monitoring operation therefore needs to be considerably developed by the Chinese.
Honourable Commissioners, we too must put our house in order, of course, and I believe much still lies in disarray in Europe.
I would not like to repeat what my fellow Members have already addressed, but instead list a few points concerning the Committee on International Trade and particularly the responsibility of European importers to introduce border checks and the need to initiate legal product recall campaigns and the issue of when to resort to import bans and import restrictions as a whole and under what conditions.
We will soon be having difficulty - at least in certain sectors, such as the textile sector - as the safeguards we currently have are expiring.
We shall then have additional problems at least in that sector.
(FR) Madam President, what should we learn from the Mattel affair?
I must make an initial observation, a digression certainly, but it is important, as has already been said.
If this trade saga has a happy ending, it is partly due to the sense of responsibility of the directors of this company, who took the necessary decisions: a mass recall and effective communication.
Secondly, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Kuneva, who has lived up to our expectations by calling for effective use of the RAPEX system, which of course could still be refined further, and by sending a firm message to the Chinese authorities.
Thirdly, I would like to express my frustration.
In reality, the Mattel affair is almost the story of a predictable failure: that of surveillance in the European Union of CE marked products, in this case toys, but they are not the only products affected.
In 2004, during the debate on the directive on the eco-design of products, I and others here this morning - I see Karin Scheele, Peter Liese, Claude Turmes - criticised the presence on the European market of other dangerous products carrying the CE label.
Our joint resolution certainly contains interesting possibilities: the revision of the existing directives, enhanced cooperation - with China in this case - more resources allocated to customs authorities and national surveillance authorities.
The two Commissioners here today stressed this essential point.
I wish someone from the Council had been here this morning: we needed them to be here.
To conclude, if Europe wishes to protect the health and safety of consumers, it must track down and convict fraudsters, as it has done, but also ban the marketing of consumer products containing dangerous substances such as CMR substances and endocrine disruptors.
(DE) Mr President, I welcome the importance the Commission is attaching to this subject today.
The fact that two Commissioners have taken the floor clearly shows that finally even the Commission understands that we have to act here.
However, doubts remain as to the statements when reference is made in the first instance to the responsibility of the Member States and manufacturers.
Certainly the Member States bear a good proportion of responsibility and market surveillance has been scaled back in recent years in many Member States.
This is the wrong response to the challenges of globalisation.
Nevertheless, this alone is not enough.
Revision of the Toy Safety Directive is urgently needed.
When we recognise that this recall campaign is now the fourth since November 2006, it raises questions, for instance: who is actually following up these recall campaigns?
What are the sanctions in the Member States and the law on importer and producer liability achieving?
We urgently need a revision of the Toy Safety Directive, which also does real justice to the new challenges.
This directive is not a response to these new challenges.
We have to address subjects such as the law on collective action.
Mr Verheugen, you have rightly addressed the fact that we have to make clear to consumers that quality is also important and that prices and quality have to reflect this.
But then I also ask myself, of course, why consumers no longer have opportunities within their grasp, under a European law on collective action for example, for insisting that something should also be changed here in relation to costs?
I would like to delve further into the subject of CE marking.
We have discussed this at length and across the board and are familiar with the failings and limitations of this CE marking.
I think it is wrong when it is suggested to consumers that CE marking is a clear signal that the product is safe.
CE marking is primarily a statement that this label complies with European directives.
It may relate to certain parts of a product, it may relate to a whole product, but it does not reveal anything as a whole about the safety of the product.
We have a flaw here, which needs to be removed from the new Toy Safety Directive as a matter of urgency.
(EL) Mr President, 65% of toys imported into the European Union are made in China.
In August one particular US toy company recalled approximately 18 million China-made toys from around the world.
The problem is the high levels of lead in the paints used in these toys.
This raises the serious question of what sort of future we want for our children.
In their desperate efforts to cut back production costs, multinationals are ignoring the cost being imposed on public health.
Mrs Kuneva, the Commissioner, has stated that she intends to revise the legislation on toys.
I congratulate her on such an initiative but, at the same time, regret the fact that the Commission is being called on yet again to close the door after the horse has bolted instead of preventing such unfortunate incidents.
(DE) Mr President, when we hear about toxic substances in babies' bibs, children's clothing and toys, or even of self-igniting batteries, it is clear that our system of controls is not working properly.
Nearly all European manufacturers have at least part of their products produced in China or other low-cost countries where cheaper products are used in order to make more profit, despite higher raw material prices and salaries.
It is, of course, the importers' responsibility to ensure compliance with the legal requirements and this depends therefore on their standards and controls.
We have a dangerous problem of mentality when responsibility is shifted onto producers with a few words, and manufacturers would rather pay fines than initiate recall campaigns.
This is where, in my view, the EU should start, perhaps by increasing fines so that they become more punishing, if information is not being passed on immediately and products recalled.
In addition, CE marking must in my view become more than pure self-regulation by the industry.
Mr President, we live and work in a global market economy, and we cannot expect to put in place legislation which interferes with that.
Commissioner Kuneva, I have nothing to say to what you have said.
I agree totally with everything you have said - my congratulations; just make sure that it is implemented.
As far as Commissioner Verheugen is concerned, I am sorry to say that the buck does stop somewhere, and it is all very well for the Commission to continue to pass the responsibility on to Member States, or whatever, but in actual fact you have to implement the legislation that is put in place by this Parliament. I believe, therefore, that it is the responsibility of your department to ensure that the products that come into the European Union are at least as safe as the products that we produce within the European Union.
I say to Ms Breyer, a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, who quite rightly talks about legislation: there is little point in putting in place legislation in the European Union if all we do is import products which do not meet the same standards that we are putting forward within the European Union.
We have put in place, for example, legislation on barometers.
How many children eat barometers?
And yet we stopped barometer production.
About 10 minutes ago, we stopped the production of sugar in the European Union, and say we have to support Tate & Lyle, which imports it.
We have things like foot-and-mouth and blue tongue coming into the European Union because we live in a global market, and yet we are not enforcing the legislation at the port of import sufficiently to ensure the safety of the products.
We do live in a global market, and the last thing I want is to see legislation that is trade defensive.
We have to accept the fact that products are going to come in from the rest of the world, but they must be of the same standard.
I want to ensure the safety of my constituents - the children, the grandchildren of the people that have elected me - when they go to buy their Christmas toys to ensure and guarantee that they are not going to die from some lead paint.
I leave you with one last thought.
As a farmer, I have seen the effects of lead paint that cattle have licked off, that has been there for years, and it just kills them in a very slow and nasty way.
Ensure and guarantee, Commissioner, that my children, my grandchildren and those of my constituents are safe.
(SV) Mr President, as a parent of young children myself, I find this matter highly relevant.
To be honest, I do not always think about what chemicals a toy contains or what standard of safety it conforms to when I buy toys for my children.
For me, it goes without saying that the toys I buy in Sweden, Brussels or Strasbourg are safe.
Perhaps you think I am naive, but I am not alone.
When I raided my daughter's toy box three weeks ago and pulled out one thing and another, I asked some neighbours along my street what they thought about this when they bought toys.
They all said that, as long as the items were sold in toy shops and had a CE label, they felt quite confident.
So our consumers are lulled into a false sense of security.
It is now our responsibility to ensure that that sense of security does not continue to be false.
I therefore appeal to the Commission to review the Toy Safety Directive as soon as possible.
What can have higher priority than our children?
Amongst other things, we must ensure that toys do not contain carcinogens.
We must introduce a ban on all carcinogenic and other toxic substances.
Many such substances accumulate in the body.
Children who are exposed to them will have them in their bodies for the rest of their lives.
This responsibility cannot be left to parents.
We do not have the expertise.
Who would buy a toy knowing that it contained carcinogens?
We must modify and strengthen the CE labelling system.
Consumers today believe that the CE mark means that a product is safe, but if that is to be the case we must have a well developed system of market surveillance and a uniform testing system.
We must also ensure that retailers and suppliers of unsafe products are made to bear full liability.
I also welcome a review of the RAPEX system.
Having talked to Swedish consumer advisers, I understand that this is a very important tool and that it is used on a routine basis.
However, it is not complete until all EU countries make use of and contribute to the system to the full extent.
Finally I want to stress once again that our consumers must be given priority, for without safe and secure consumers we shall not have a flourishing internal market.
(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by creating an internal market, the EU, primarily and most efficiently, is implementing the free movement of goods.
The EU is implementing the New Approach Directives in order to protect consumers.
The Toy Safety Directive is one of them.
EU manufactures are responsible for the safety of the goods they produce.
Are importers responsible for the safety of goods?
The situation in the European and global toy markets differs greatly.
Only last August, the US toy manufacturer Mattel recalled almost 19 million toys manufactured in China.
Mattel toys are sold in the EU too.
In 2006 half of all products sold in the EU that were deemed hazardous to health were manufactured in China.
The same safety requirements should be applicable not only to EU manufacturers, but also to exporters in non-EU countries intending to sell their products in the EU internal market.
I believe that manufacturers that transfer production from the EU to China can do much to influence this issue and they must take full responsibility.
They cannot simply make use of the cheap labour force in China, but should also be honest with their consumers - the citizens of their countries.
I would encourage the Commission to review the Toy Safety Directive as soon as possible, to introduce clear toy safety criteria and CE marking control and to protect our children from dangerous toys brought onto the EU market.
Furthermore, on the subject of the certification of institutions, I believe it should be compulsory for manufacturers and importers to lose their production certification if the products they place on the market are recognised as unsafe, that is, when confidence is lost.
(SV) Mr President, we buy toys for our children so that they can have fun and be stimulated in their development.
Without exception, parents expect society to protect children, but current legislation makes it possible for us to put toxic bombs in our children's hands.
Mr Verheugen says that lead is banned in toys, but the truth is that the law permits an intake of 0.7 microgram per day.
However, the law leaves industry to set the standard for how safety is to be achieved, and that is where protection for our children stops.
The standard says that the 1985 toxicity data are sufficient.
The Commission's own experts want an update.
The standard says that the entire daily intake can be imputed to toys.
The experts say a maximum of 10%, which would mean a requirement ten times more stringent.
The standard assumes that no child swallows more than 8 milligrams from a toy.
The experts think that is absurd.
The standard only requires one toy per category to be tested, not every product.
The experts think that is absurd.
The Commission's own experts regard the protection as a disaster, and this is only the beginning.
Thirty-four aromas which are banned in cosmetics are permitted in toys.
Carcinogens, mutagens and reproduction toxins which are banned in cosmetics are permitted in toys.
Allergens are also permitted in toys.
The Commission has known about the problem for ten years.
Now we want legislation, a law which protects our children both on paper and in reality.
Why do the toys industry and the governments get the documents but Parliament does not?
- (FR) Mr President, 65% of the toys distributed in Europe, sold in Europe, are made in China, and the presence of our two Commissioners shows just how important this problem is.
This is not only a safety issue but also a health issue affecting a specific consumer group, namely our children.
When very young children are involved, the problem is even more serious.
We cannot compromise on safety, especially when the products concerned are intended for small children.
I especially worry about the failure of Member States to carry out the necessary controls.
We know that many products made in China are dangerous, but it does not just concern toys, it also concerns textiles and now vehicles.
Therefore, this is a huge problem and the European Commission must properly address this issue.
This is why I am in favour of raising safety standards - the famous CE safety mark - so that we can reduce the risk of dangerous substances being present in products that come from China.
I am mainly thinking of chemicals, which we have discussed a great deal.
It is a question of corporate responsibility, although Mattel showed that it accepted responsibility.
The responsibility of Member States is even more important: it is even more important because I am deeply concerned about what will happen with Internet sales.
How can we be sure that the toys recalled by Mattel will not go on sale to European consumers over the Internet?
What control do we have?
Consumer information is important: consumers must be aware of the risks of buying these products and must realise that low prices and cheap goods do not go hand in hand with health and safety.
It is also important that we introduce controls - controls at production sites, controls carried out independently and autonomously - and that we prevent these stocks of faulty products from flooding the market and doing more harm.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has said that the subject occupying us today is primarily a problem of failure to comply with existing laws.
This is partly true.
We as the European Parliament should not neglect sending a clear message to the Member States that we cannot demand increasingly strict European laws and then not take enough money at home to guarantee their implementation.
It has also been stated, however, that we ought to apply the strictest standards of all in the toy sector.
This is where the Toy Safety Directive, which has been in existence for a long time, needs to be revised.
When this directive is revised, I am expecting a clear stance to the effect that the strictest standards of all will be applied and chemicals classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction will be banned.
Today I hope that we in the European Parliament will hold to this position in the decisions we make.
Not only does this discussion about toys provide evidence that CE labelling is misleading, but also the many discussions at home with our citizens do so too.
As I see it, we are hoping for either an indication of origin or at least a certain level of quality.
I think that as part of the revision we should rethink how we can mislead our citizens less.
I would say straightaway that I cannot quite understand voluntary safety labelling either.
In Europe and the European Union we have to become better at conformity, but it makes no sense to develop specific labelling as a reward for the fact that we have been complying with the existing laws for a long time.
I am very sceptical about this and I think that it is more important to focus on monitoring the implementation of strict rules.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioners, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, I would like to say that cooperation between the European Commission and China is of course of exceptional importance and that we are following the Commission's activities there as closely as possible.
I would, however, also like to inquire about our Chinese colleagues' activities in China.
I can tell you that, somewhat by coincidence, a Chinese delegation is here this week, as our interparliamentary meeting is being held tomorrow and the day after, and also that one of the items on the agenda is precisely product safety and the way in which we can cooperate more effectively in that regard.
Should the Commissioner have any additional suggestions for items for the agenda - incidentally, we have already received a memorandum from the Commission in this regard - we would of course welcome those suggestions, as it is of course clear that cooperation between China and Europe is of particularly great importance.
I would like to point out that the Commissioner has already made efforts to that effect during the summer and that a further follow-up is expected in October.
With regard to collaboration within our RAPEX system, in which we exchange information with the Chinese and the Chinese AQSIQ authorities, affairs must run as smoothly as possible.
Nevertheless, it cannot reach a situation whereby we - that is the authorities, the government - assume responsibility for products.
If we are to control each product, manufacturers should be able to say 'let them go ahead and do it; we can see what we are introducing onto the market'.
Responsibility must remain with the manufacturer.
This also became abundantly clear in the Mattel case.
Manufacturers must ensure that their products are safe by means of research and checks.
Moreover, we must ensure that these checks are implemented as effectively as possible across Europe and China and that we can determine what is happening by means of spot checks.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a very calm discussion this morning.
I welcome this greatly, but it is a very difficult subject.
We have three problems in all with consumer products, and with toys in particular, and these have already been amply discussed.
Firstly, market surveillance - and you, Commissioner Verheugen, have indeed addressed the fact that an iron was wrongly given two different safety labels on Europe's internal market.
This is bad enough, but the worst thing is that a Member State found this iron and did not inform the other Member States about it until a year later.
There is a need for change here, particularly in the Council.
Secondly, importer liability has already been addressed.
I can only support what has been said here.
However, I believe that a crucial problem - and this is my third point - lies in the fact that we have different approaches at European level.
On the one hand, we have the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD), which applies to all consumer goods, and on the other hand the New Approach.
This varied approach to consumer products is still not completely watertight at all points.
Hence my belief that we need the CE marking that applies in the New Approach as a basis for safety and for products entering the internal market, and that we need additional certification for all those manufacturers on the European internal market and beyond, which must be voluntary, and which offers European manufacturers the opportunity to raise standards as a whole in global competition - because Europe's internal market is the world's largest internal consumer market, bigger than the USA and bigger than all the others in this product sector.
This solution - a voluntary one with a basic principle legally governed by regulation at European level - offers the consumer the security of knowing what has been assigned to a product by a certificate.
We therefore have an internal market-friendly solution as well as a solution for dealing with globalisation.
One further point on toys.
There are many different types of toys.
It is totally clear to me that a teddy, which children put in their mouths, naturally has to meet different conditions than a computer keyboard and we should also factor this differentiation into the implementation of the legislation.
Hence my appeal to our Members: let us therefore think about taking CE marking as a basis for all goods coming onto the internal market and additional, voluntary certification for consumer goods.
(FR) Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the recall by the US toy manufacturer Mattel of several million toys made in China is significant for three reasons.
First of all, it confirms the urgent need for a revision of the 1988 Toys Directive.
Secondly, this event shows the need for greater control and market surveillance, the need to make CE marking compulsory and to ensure that it is truly credible.
Finally, we are right to question the failings of the current trade globalisation model, and to ask ourselves how the world's leading toy manufacturer could not work with reliable subcontractors.
The European Union must be extremely vigilant, both in terms of health and safety standards and in terms of respect for ILO core labour standards, in all countries with which it has signed partnership, cooperation or free trade agreements.
(DE) Mr President, first of all, thank you to both Vice-President Verheugen and Commissioner Kuneva for being here and enhancing the debate.
If commercial and economic policy has a truly important task, it is where the safety of our children is concerned.
Children's toys have become increasingly inexpensive in recent decades and the cheaper the toy, the greater the likelihood that it was not produced in the EU.
I have to say even as a Liberal that there is justifiable doubt that parents always know best what is good for their children when buying toys.
The range is colossal and unmanageable.
Quality toys produced in Europe such as Lego, Playmobil, Märklin, Brio wooden trains or Wader plastic toys are also correspondingly expensive.
Competition needs people who can and want to take responsibility.
Anyone who buys their children the cheapest junk toys untested does not want this responsibility!
We also have to consider whether the Commission should launch an information campaign for parents like these.
Yes, I am in favour of free trade, but not at any price!
As Europeans, we have certain standards, and - this has been repeatedly addressed here - we have to implement them in a clearer way.
At this point I should like to highlight once again the 'Made in ...' campaign.
Following the current events, it may be time to introduce a mandatory designation of origin, at least for toys.
I know Commissioner Kuneva's efforts on this issue and can only encourage her in them.
The label on the product must be sufficiently large.
Even though we are not in a position to change production conditions in China, this would at least educate citizens about this to a sufficient level.
Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Kuneva, Commssioner Verheugen, colleagues, I would like to start where the previous speaker ended.
I believe that all in this Parliament would agree that the best protected consumer is only the informed consumer.
If the safety of the products placed on the market is a priority for all of us, the safety of children's toys is twice as important because children are the most vulnerable group of consumers.
We would all like to see only safe children's toys on the market and therefore we often rely on the CE marking.
Most manufacturers outside the European Union have understood that European importers will no longer run the risk of offering on the market products that do not conform to this marking.
At the same time, our citizens firmly believe that it is the guarantee of quality and, especially, a guarantee of security.
It is in this sense, Mr. Chairman, that the recognition of the precise meaning of the CE marking is of special importance to all of us.
Many surveys reveal that, unfortunately, many consumers, especially in the new Member States, are not familiar with the actual meaning of this marking.
Therefore I would like to call upon the Comission:
To organize a public awareness campiagn, once the European Parliament has made a decision on the new approach, to inform the European citizens about the actual meaning of the CE'marking because one of the best ways to protect the rights of 500 million consumers on the European market is to raise their awareness and because only the informed consumer is the best protected consumer.
(ES) Mr President, the recall of dangerous toys in August and September caused public alarm.
However, I do not think that we should add to the alarm as, in general, the toys sold in Europe are surely the safest in the world.
However, reality shows us that we need to improve European safety standards, especially for those products that consumers have direct contact with, such as toys or textile products.
The situation that arose should lead to greater market surveillance, inspection and the banning or withdrawal of dangerous products.
However, sometimes the only priority is increasing profit margins, generating growing pressure on businesses and increasing the risks.
We need to demand that China improves safety, but it is essential to cooperate with them to achieve these objectives.
Before the Christmas period, when millions of toys are bought in Europe, all the authorities involved, from the Commission to local authorities, as well as companies producing and marketing toys, need to act responsibly, maximise precautions and commit themselves to guaranteeing the safety of toys.
We all have a great interest in offering transparency, safety and confidence to European consumers.
(CS) Commissioner, we have to give parents back their trust in the European market.
Since the health of children is at stake, we want to act fast and we are now discussing how to do that.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that we need a new law or even a new marking as soon as a problem develops.
We must first of all persuade countries to test their product safety mechanisms.
Secondly, we must negotiate with third countries in order to ensure that they, too, introduce safety standards for the products they export to our Union.
The Commission's analysis that we are soon to be presented with will expose the flaws in product safety control in Member States. Then perhaps we will find out why, for example, Denmark and Austria allow more dangerous products through than Germany, despite having the same laws.
Commissioner, I am pleased that you have started the negotiations with the Chinese Government in such an uncompromising manner. That is the right direction at last and I hope that the other Commissioners will follow that example.
Now I will turn back to Europe.
I would call on the Commission to focus on how to prevent misuse of the marking that tells citizens that they are buying a harmless product.
A new marking will not solve this problem.
We simply need sufficient sanctions for misuse of the existing CE marking.
In that way, without incurring high costs, manufacturers will improve their internal quality control and other dangerous products that are on the market will be quickly withdrawn, not just toys.
Significant penalties are incorporated in the Slovak legislation concerning toys, for example; that is not the situation in the Czech Republic.
At any rate, countries are expected to impose fines for the provision of false information on toys, footwear and other products under their general legislation.
That is why I am asking the Commission to ensure that the Member States assume their responsibilities, for once and for all.
(PT) The topic under discussion today has been on the agenda ever since the US giant Mattel recalled 21 million toys because they were dangerous.
Today I should like to congratulate the Commissioner for her promise of firmness and action.
I only hope that she will act effectively before the strong euro and the Christmas period combine to flood the European market with dangerous imported toys.
However, we still need clear answers to two questions.
Firstly, if the Mattel affair had not happened, can the Commission assure us that European consumer safety would have merited this attention?
What specific lessons does the Commission draw from this on the meaning of the 'CE' marking, the responsibility for control conferred on producers and importers and, in general, on the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanisms in the European market?
Secondly, this is not a short-term problem.
What is happening with toys is also happening with textiles and many other products.
The European Union's high standards with regard to the environment, health and quality are in practice constantly being breached by imports, subcontracting and relocation of Europe's businesses.
How does the Commission intend to overcome that fundamental contradiction in today's global market?
Thank you.
(SK) Toys are very sensitive goods that affect human health from an early age.
The news that American toy manufacturer Mattel is withdrawing three million Chinese toys from the market on account of high lead levels and the detachment of small magnets concerned me as a strong advocate of consumer protection and at the same time prompted me to initiate legislation.
The issue of small magnets, which, I should mention, pose a new safety risk that should also be dealt with immediately in a directive on toy safety, must be brought before the European Parliament without further delay.
Within the Rapex system it is necessary to explain its objective so that it is understood by all Member States alike.
It must be stated clearly whether the primary objective of Rapex is to notify the risk posed by a specific dangerous product or to notify identified channels by which dangerous products reach the single European market, which is very time-consuming.
Experience shows that the CE conformity marking does not provide sufficient certainty that the product concerned is in fact safe.
In the case of toys the situation is further complicated by the fact that the manufacturer does not have to issue a declaration of conformity.
To the supervisory authority the CE marking is the only indication as to whether conformity, that is to say de facto safety, has been assessed.
In the debate on whether it is desirable to support or abolish further use of the CE marking I support its retention, provided that entitlement and marking are monitored by the Member States' supervisory authorities.
I should mention that the consumer public is beginning to perceive this marking as a technical passport for all products entering the single European market.
In drawing up the legislative package relating to the review of the new approach directives known as the 'Goods Package', in which I am closely involved as one of the shadow rapporteurs for the PPE-DE political group, it is necessary to discuss in greater detail the need to place further marking on goods, such as the K-markt quality mark already in use, or new marks that would place an excessive burden on undertakings, primarily small and medium-sized businesses, and might be confusing for final consumers.
I believe that together we will succeed in creating effective tools to ensure that this year children only get safe toys for Christmas.
(RO) Mr. President, the latest voluntary withdrawal of dangerous products manufactured in China raises serious questions related to the correct implementation of the European legislation on consumer protection.
These products bore the EC label, thus facilitating the exportation of the toys to the European market by the Chinese manufacturers.
Many consumers misunderstand the significance of this mark, believing that this symbol is a guarantee that the products were manufactured in Europe.
Nevertheless, giving up the EC mark is not a viable solution, because it represents an advantage for the European manufacturers in international trade.
It is necessary to find an additional label to the already existing one, which would introduce mandatory inspections and drastic penalties for those abusing the EC mark.
In order to prevent any future placing on the market of potentially dangerous products, it is important for the national consumer protection authorities to improve their measures of monitoring and investigating compliance with the EU legislation.
Moreover, national authorities must assure consumers that they have the right to get their money back for the dangerous products they purchased.
(PL) Mr President, most of the events that have been linked to the withdrawal of toys of Chinese manufacture have centred on excessively high levels of lead.
A short-term solution to this problem is to withdraw post factum all articles that give cause for concern.
But this is a solution that is effective in the short term, and one with many tragic consequences, such as the suicide of the boss of one of the companies that produces the toys.
A much better and more promising solution is to establish a safe limit for the amount of lead in the manufacture of toys, and of other articles too.
Previous arrangements have been based on a recommendation formula which has negligible force, as witnessed by the large discrepancies between the permissible amounts of lead in different Member States.
We have to introduce genuinely binding limits that hold for all EU countries.
Furthermore, as much as I approve of the RAPEX system, I am of the view that the most important thing where the safety of imported toys is concerned is to concentrate on coordinating actions at the level of the whole Community.
Incidentally I would like to point out that the EU should apply thorough monitoring of all products imported from China.
The subject of toys is just one element in a broader problem area.
I would like to use this debate to draw attention to something that appears to have been forgotten.
I do not hear too many voices talking about child safety in China.
Children from this country are frequently exploited for work in inhumane conditions.
The employment of children who are often under ten is universal, for example to work in brickworks.
This is an exceptionally live issue, particularly with the Olympic Games coming up.
According to a report from the International Trade Union Confederation, factories producing gadgets for these Olympics are allowing breaches of employment laws, including the exploitation of small children as slaves.
Although international organisations like the Fair Play Alliance, for example, are concentrating on conditions for the manufacture of souvenirs for next year's Olympics, I am of the view that the European Parliament should take a stance on this matter.
(DA) Mr President, I would like to say to the two Commissioners that I agree with your view that we have a problem with market surveillance.
This represents a weak point within the internal market today.
The initiatives of the Member States relating to market surveillance are simply not good enough.
For example, in my own country, Denmark, there has been a cut in the funds allocated to general product safety monitoring.
I urgently request that you use all the funds at your disposal to pressure the Member States into doing more in terms of market surveillance.
It is absolutely crucial that we secure and strengthen this.
However, market surveillance alone is not enough.
We also need better rules, and this is something that we are working on at the moment; this includes the product package for the internal market and subsequently the Toys Directive.
We need minimum rules for market surveillance.
We need to impose stronger requirements on producers and importers, and we need to enforce the consequences of not abiding by the rules applicable to the market.
However, we are working on this and we hope that it will be implemented soon.
(NL) Mr President, it is good that we as a Parliament are making our voice heard in the discussion that is taking place in the media, as product safety directly affects our citizens and our children.
Mr President, I stand here with a positive attitude, because international trade contributes towards improved prosperity, both here and elsewhere in the world.
China is a major trading partner.
For that reason, we must invest in strong contacts and fair trade relations that benefit China and also our citizens in Europe.
We therefore cannot and must not tolerate non compliance of our trading partners' products with the safety standards that we have laid down in our legislation.
Approximately half of the warnings in respect of dangerous import products relate to products from China, and not only to toys, but also to toothpaste, body lotion, beds, colour rinses, dog and cat food and even pacemakers.
Mr President, we in Europe must improve the order in our regulations and checks and make appropriate efforts so that safe products are manufactured in China and third countries.
That is of course one of the responsibilities of the manufacturers themselves, who must not aim solely for the lowest price, but it is also the responsibility of our Commissioner for Trade, Mr Mandelson.
I feel that it is commendable that two commissioners are represented here, but would you also please ensure that Commissioner Mandelson places product safety far higher on the agenda for the trade conferences, because it is at these conferences that we can exact measures and must put up a fight.
We must of course also offer technical assistance, but product safety must constitute a major element in trading agreements with, for example, China.
If necessary, we then have an incentive - in other words, sanctions.
Therefore, Commissioner Kuneva, take a firm line in our trade relations too; involve Commissioner Mandelson, because thus far, he has unfortunately not yet shown appreciation for this topic.
Mr President, one of the first speeches I made in this House 23 years ago was on the then proposal for a Toy Safety Directive.
I welcome the plans now to strengthen that Directive.
But let us make it clear: the Mattel problem would almost certainly be with us with or without a strengthened Toy Safety Directive.
I believe we need three courses of action, which other colleagues have mentioned this morning.
Firstly, we have to push manufacturers to take a greater interest in their supply chain and, if necessary, apply penalties to those who do not take that interest.
Secondly, we need the Commission to bring together the Member States to ensure tougher inspections in Europe, to ensure adequate customs control and to ensure the application of the existing European Union laws.
With China, we know that it does not respond to health and safety concerns, but it does respond to economic threats.
We should consider banning the use of the CE mark on all products from China until it establishes a clearly independent, high-quality accreditation and testing centre or centres in China.
Only then can we have some confidence in the goods that are coming from China, and only through such action will China respond.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in the summer, Mattel recalled 20 million toys from China, thereby reopening the debate on the value of CE marking and sanctions against operators who do not meet European standards.
What will it take before the EU reacts?
Brazil has already banned imports.
The United States and Canada are starting an inquiry.
As for us, we are debating.
The Commission must take action.
This means: revising EU legislations on toys before Christmas, insisting on the need for maximum harmonisation; ensuring that manufacturers comply with safety standards, as well as social and environmental standards - why not introduce a new European label to reinforce CE marking?; reviewing the effectiveness of controls and penalising manufacturers if necessary; clarifying the responsibilities of producers and importers; stepping up market surveillance through real customs cooperation between Member States.
The responsibility and credibility of the EU in the eyes of consumers is at stake.
How can we encourage consumers to have a positive image of Europe if we cannot restore their confidence?
(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, there are countless unscrupulous manufacturers and company directors around the world who trade within the WTO.
They do not care about the environment any more than about the health of their employees and customers, or that these may be children.
For them, profits must be had at any price.
These are not just Chinese companies and they do not just sell toys.
They must be confronted with institutions and legislation capable of blocking their fraudulent - even criminal - practices.
We have to recognise the weakness of our control systems and question the meaning of CE marking on products marketed in Europe.
This marking should mean that products comply with European legislation and not that they might comply with them, which is misleading for consumers.
CE marking is pointless if it is not based on genuine product safety.
This is what European consumers demand, just as they demand that their health be put before market interests.
To this end, the European Union must be firmer in its negotiations with the WTO.
(PL) Mr President, what we are doing today is reacting to a critical situation, as we fear for the life and health of our children.
In the proposed resolution we are concentrating chiefly on product safety, the product being a toy.
What we are looking for is for this product to be made according to European standards.
We want better control, we want a safe product, because European consumers, be they large or small, must feel safe.
But this is not the only possible reaction.
Fellow members, a toy is not just a market product, and regarding it from the aspect of safety and price alone is not good enough.
A toy is something more than just another form of goods - it shapes a child's thoughts, helps it to develop, impacts on its education - which is why I am calling for the Commission, when it reviews the Toy Safety Directive, to bear these things in mind too.
Commissioner, we are using this review to give our children something more than a Chinese product that reflects American popular culture.
Our children must have a wider choice of toys, including toys that have a European spirit to them.
They deserve this.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a batch of toys imported from China turns out to be unsafe.
That requires cooperation with the Chinese authorities.
Work needs to be done at the start of the product chain where this happens.
Multinationals are not without guilt.
They invest in the country because of the cheap labour force.
I expect the Commission to adopt a comprehensive, high quality and safe product policy that is based on the following measures.
I support what my fellow members have said with regard to imposing a rigorous revision of the legislation relating to the CE marking, with liability regulations for importers and facilities for placing sanctions on those that infringe upon the regulations.
Mattel declared that it made a mistake and I therefore expect the Commission to reprimand Mattel heavily.
An agreement must be made within the framework of the WTO to combat unsafe products from China or elsewhere, even those for onward export.
A greater level of cross-border cooperation is required on the part of the market supervisory authorities and customs.
That requires political will and requires financial resources.
These already exist for safety in the workplace and for food safety, so why not for product safety too?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years the approach taken to 'free' trade has been completely ideological: the single dogma of laissez-faire globalisation.
We now find ourselves struggling with problems such as dangerous products, which is particularly worrying in that toys are involved.
Is there a problem with China?
Yes!
It concerns the guarantee rules that must be complied with.
Yet we are thinking about an effective guarantee mark that would be in addition to the CE mark and, for products from outside Europe, even the possibility of a recognition mark, the 'made in' mark.
There is also a problem, however, with Western multinationals manufacturing products in China or elsewhere, which have major responsibilities for safety and control, including for toys; there is also the problem that products declared to be made in Europe should really be made in Europe.
We cannot ask China to respect employment rights and environmental standards, as it must do, while concealing the fact that our multinationals are also responsible for violations of this kind.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it was really a very interesting and very deep discussion and I am grateful to all of you.
This discussion brought a lot of doubts and a lot of concrete measures, which, in a way, had already been anticipated by the Commission.
I am glad to say this because, as we can confirm, these measures are well elaborated upon together with Parliament.
I believe that, whatever kind of signals we could give, like the resolution you produced, or proposals by the Commission, or trying to intervene with benchmarks from the Commission to compare how the different Member States work on the ground, we can succeed only if there is a common vision for the future, a vision which is based on open societies and free market, and in the first place, when we are talking about consumers, that we will not comprise on consumer safety.
Finally, I should like once more to reiterate that for me this is of the utmost importance and I will not compromise on this issue.
Several of you referred to RAPEX.
RAPEX works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which means that there is no delay in notification through RAPEX.
And I would like you to talk to your local communities to advertise RAPEX, because through these notifications we have, in many ways, already prevented dangerous goods from being put on the market.
It is very important to reiterate that by recalling goods, economic operators are complying with an obligation under European legislation.
It is not a matter of good will: it is because general product safety exists in European legislation.
The lead paint in the Mattel case was detected first in the course of the tests carried out on behalf of the European distributor.
So we should never underestimate the efficiency of our RAPEX.
We are also extending RAPEX-China, which is very important.
Just before I finish, I would like to inform you that I asked Mattel what it has done with the recalled toys.
I was thinking about the internet in particular and how those goods could be reached through the internet.
I would like to tell you that all the toys have been destroyed, and this has been confirmed by Mattel.
I think that all of us should assume our obligations, and this is the only way the Community can proceed.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, two more factual clarifications.
Firstly, the European rules on product quality and product safety apply to every product, irrespective of where it is produced.
Regardless of whether a product is produced in China or Europe, if it is brought onto the European market, the same regulations apply 100%, since there is no distinction at all.
This goes without saying.
Secondly, I will say it once more: obviously, even the old existing Toy Safety Directive bans the importation of dangerous toys.
Toys that Mattel has recalled did not comply with European rules and could not be marketed in Europe.
I now come to the two major complex issues that have played a crucial role in this debate.
First of all, the Toy Safety Directive.
The Commission, of which I am a part, announced the revision of the directive at the beginning of 2005.
The beginning of 2005!
Since then it has been part of the Commission's legislative programme.
This legislative programme has been discussed in this Parliament.
I have not heard that any Member of Parliament has demanded that the new Toy Safety Directive must be in place any sooner.
Nor would this be possible.
This is such a complicated and enormously huge market, that you cannot come up with it just like that.
I guarantee once again: this new Toy Safety Directive will be in place by the end of the year.
The policy instruction to officials, on which they are working, is: the strictest possible regulations in relation to toy safety, the 'strictest possible'.
This, for instance, expressly includes - because several people have said so here - the fact that I gave instructions, a long time ago and not just now, that carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic chemical substances should not be used in toys.
There are still more than 900 of them.
All this has already been decided.
Then there is the question of market surveillance and CE marking.
I should say, Mr Sturdy, that it is really not right to blame the Commission for the fact that we respect the legally enshrined division of labour between the European level and the Member States.
Market surveillance is the sole responsibility of the Member States.
What we can do - and this we are doing - is to strengthen and improve cooperation, but we cannot assume responsibility.
A series of requests has been made here as to how we could improve the system.
I am very happy about these requests because they pinpoint precisely what the Commission put to you at the beginning of this year on the reform of the internal market.
It demanded that the Member States should be obliged to carry out market surveillance internally and at external borders - and this is precisely what is stated in our proposals.
The Member States should be forced to make appropriate resources available - this is included in our proposal.
The Member States should be compelled to exchange important information immediately - this is included in our proposal.
And finally, it has been proposed that strict penalties and sanctions be applied to those who breach the rules - this, too, is included in our proposal.
Therefore, as a matter of urgency, I appeal to you, the European Parliament, and to the Council, which not present here, to discuss the Commission's proposals from the beginning of the year without delay and to adopt them.
Then the greater part of what has rightly been demanded here today will already have been completed.
(Applause)
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.

The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 26 September 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the movement of goods is a self-regulating system.
Dangerous toys made in China are a problem for us all.
Many millions have made their way out of Asia and entered Europe and the USA.
Who is responsible for this?
The manufacturer?
The sub-contractor?
The importer?
Everyone?
Or no one?
In the present era of progressive globalisation, nothing could be more wrong than to think that the problems of others have no bearing on us.
The EU is trying to face up to these challenges and has therefore proposed a regulation on marketing of goods.
By the end of the year, a review of the Toy Safety Directive should also have been proposed.
In my opinion, the problem of product marketing is linked to several further questions, and these need to be emphasised:
information for the consumer on goods bought by him/her; good information is the best consumer protection,
market surveillance by Member States,
enhanced cooperation between States,
a new approach to the CE mark which symbolises a safe product that meets EU requirements.
These are just some of the many suggestions for improving the current situation with regard to product marketing and consumer protection.
We are just at the start of a long road which will end in a market that is free of uncontrolled and hazardous goods.
Much work still lies ahead, but EU legislation is the right way forward and gives us hope that the future will be free of hazards from everyday items and that neither we nor our children will be threatened by them.
in writing. - Consumer safety raises serious concerns among our citizens when threats can be identified endangering the most vulnerable ones, namely: our children.
We ought therefore to address rapidly and transparently these concerns as there cannot be compromises when consumer safety is at stake.
The European Union should indeed ensure thoroughly the respect of its high standards when importing goods from countries with lesser quality production standards like China.
In this respect, the role of RAPEX, the system for the rapid exchange of information on dangerous non-food consumer products (including dangerous toys), is of the utmost importance as the flow of imports from countries like China is enormous.
We thus need detailed and regular reporting and to provide our partners with the necessary consumer safety requirements so that they can effectively track down potentially dangerous products.
Consumers' trust is essential, we therefore have to further focus on prevention, rapid reaction mechanisms and the effective enforcement of the Union's standards requirements.
in writing. - The recent recall of millions of toys by US manufacturer Mattel, over safety concerns, including lead content, has raised alarm bells world-wide.
This issue is a concern to all, because public health and safety is at stake.
An updated directive is critical to protecting our domestic interests, and children's health.
I call on the Commission to take action on the problem of dangerous products and consider an alternative regulatory approach.
Chinese authorities must take appropriate action to improve their standards of production, but equally important is the duty of toy companies, who order products from the Far East in order to benefit from lower costs, to ensure that safety standards are met.
Product safety is a matter of public health and this issue needs immediate attention.

Restructuring of the sugar industry (vote)
- Report: Batzeli
- Before the vote on Amendment 8:
(DE) Mr President, this proposal concerns the investment held by farmers in the restructuring fund and the Committee has approved the wording: '...50% of the relevant restructuring aid ...'
I should like to change it to 25%.
This has been agreed with the other groups and I hope that this can be adopted.
(The oral amendment was accepted.)
- Before the vote on the legislative resolution:
(DE) Mr President, on behalf of our Group I would like to request referral back to the Committee in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The reason is that we have just agreed on a 25% investment by the sugar beet growers in the restructuring fund, but the Commission is insisting on 10%.
In the latest version the Member States were able to go beyond this.
This too has now been abolished.
We were already considering on the last occasion whether we ought to be asking for referral back to the Committee at this point and therefore allowed ourselves to be satisfied with 10%.
We ought not to be doing so once again!
Our only opportunity - because we are in a consultation procedure - to get into discussion with the Commission, is to refer the report back now and to negotiate with the Commission and Council.
Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, I do not believe it is right to take this back to committee.
I think we want to make the decision.
We need to get on with the restructuring, and so I would not want to bring this back to committee, and I am afraid I am against what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf wants to do.
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I do not agree with the proposal by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
I would like to make myself perfectly clear to the House: we have just voted for a proposal on the basis of which for the first time all producers are being given a lump sum of EUR 260 plus EUR 25.
Thus the total subsidy is almost in the region of EUR 400.
From a financial point of view, this is balanced, and I believe that it will help the sector as a whole.
(The request for referral back to committee was rejected.)

Common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (vote)
- Report: Batzeli
- Before the vote on Amendment 1:
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, allow me to skip reading the technical text of the amendment - provided, of course, you do not agree with the policy issue which I put to you:


Article 10(2) of Regulation No 318/2006 is about the institution of a possible additional reduction in sugar quotas for the post-2010 period.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed the amendment in advance, before we could even know the results of the implementation of the new CMO in the Member States and in businesses.
The amendment suggests a linear reduction of 13.5% in the rate for the post-2010 period.
If, for example, the Commission proposes a reduction of 10% for the post-2010 period, there will be a problem.
My oral amendment is simply intended to send a message and provide a basic methodology to be adopted for the post-2013 period for a possible additional reduction.
The amendment will take into account the conduct of businesses, i.e., to what extent businesses have adapted to the status quo and the situation of the Member States.
(The oral amendment was not accepted.)

Explanations of vote
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague, Mrs Niebler, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between the European Community and the State of Israel.
I wholeheartedly congratulate the European Commission, which negotiated this Agreement based on the principles of mutual benefit, reciprocal opportunities for participating in each party's programmes and activities in the areas covered by the Agreement, non-discrimination, effective protection of intellectual property and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights.
I voted in favour of the report by my Spanish colleague, Mr Galeote, on the proposal for a Council decision authorising France to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on 'traditional' rum produced in its overseas departments and repealing the Council Decision of 18 February 2002.
The proposed decision authorises France to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on a significant quota of 'traditional' rum produced in its overseas departments from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2012.
It increases the volume and duration of the tax arrangements currently applied to traditional rum because the situation has worsened over the last few years.
This is excellent news for cane-sugar-rum sector production, which is crucial to the economic and social balance of these territories.
I am pleased that this vote at first reading without amendment is opening the way to a swift adoption of this text and I recognise the important work done by my French colleague, Mrs Sudre, who staunchly defended this matter in the Committee on Regional Development.
The new tax arrangements take account of the fact that the competitiveness of traditional rum from the overseas departments has deteriorated considerably since 2001, and that support for the cane-sugar-rum sector is crucial to the economic and social balance of these regions.
The measure is proportional to the additional costs borne by the sector as a result of the handicaps associated with outermost region status, particularly remoteness, the small market and the difficult topography, which explains the high price of sugar cane.
The Commission opportunely took into account that 40 000 jobs depend directly or indirectly on sugar cane cultivation, across a total of 5 500 farms.
The new tax system should also contribute to the maintenance of ten distilleries in Guadeloupe, nine in Martinique, three in Réunion and one in French Guiana, as well as 22 000 jobs directly connected with rum production.
European aid will help ensure a trade outlet for rum from the overseas departments, resisting competition from ACP producers, and will benefit local producers who have been waiting for a positive sign, conscious of the extreme difficulties they face over the next few years, particularly following the devastation wrought by Cyclone Dean in the Antilles last month.
in writing. - (SV) I voted against Gerardo Galeote's report today.
France must not be allowed to favour rum producers in its overseas departments by lower taxes than permitted.
The best way to help agriculture in the less developed countries is through tariffs on agricultural products from all countries in the world and by scrapping the common agricultural policy (CAP).
In addition, excise duties on alcohol serve the purpose of moderating alcohol consumption.
The damaging effects of alcohol are exactly the same when the alcohol is produced in Guadeloupe or Martinique as when it is produced somewhere else.
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Mr Mayer on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on passenger hand-holds on two-wheel motor vehicles (codified version).
I am taking advantage of this explanation of vote to criticise the delay in the codification of European law.
With regard to this matter, the facts date back to 27 March 2003, when the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Directive 93/32/EEC on passenger hand-holds on two-wheel motor vehicles.
In its opinion of 26 June 2003 the Consultative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts stated that this proposal did indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it.
Yet it is only in September 2007 that we are voting on this codification.
This is not right.
I call on the European Commission to accelerate the codification of European law.
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Mr Mayer on the amended proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles (codified version).
I am taking advantage of this explanation of vote to criticise the delay in the codification of European law.
The facts date back to 28 March 2003, when the European Commission presented a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Directive 93/31/EEC on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles.
In its opinion of 26 June 2003 the Consultative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts stated that this proposal did indeed confine itself to straightforward codification, without any substantive changes to the acts covered by it.
Yet it is only in September 2007 that we are voting on this codification.
This is not right.
I call on the European Commission to accelerate the codification of European law.
I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Mr Mayer on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (codified version).
I am taking advantage of this explanation of vote to criticise the delay in the codification of European law.
With regard to this matter, the facts date back to 5 September 2006, when the Commission presented the proposal for the codification of Council Directive 93/94/EEC of 29 October 1993 relating to the space for mounting the rear registration plate of two or three-wheel vehicles.
I do not know whether this was referred to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts.
In any case, it is only in September 2007 that we are voting on this codification.
This is not right.
I call on the European Commission to accelerate the codification of European law.
in writing. - (PT) We know that Community education and training statistics were developed in the past decade based on an informal agreement between the Member States as a response to the Council Resolution of 5 December 1994 on the promotion of education and training statistics in the European Union.
Those statistics are compiled by the Member States and forwarded to the Commission (Eurostat) annually on a voluntary basis through a joint action carried out with the OECD and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, usually referred to as the 'UOE data collection'.
Eurostat also collects data on education, training and lifelong learning through other sources in addition to data on vocational training in enterprises.
Now there is an attempt to have a new legal framework to regulate and formalise the production of Community statistics if there is to be a viable system for producing statistics in these sectors, but there were some gaps and some confusion which it was necessary to clarify during the Parliamentary debate.
The final text therefore appears to ensure greater transparency; it is also hoped that implementation will not impose undue administrative or financial burdens.
in writing. - (SK) I congratulate Nikolaos Sifunakis on his well-prepared report.
I voted unequivocally for the document submitted.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education in relation to a proposal to establish a European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning, I welcome this legislative initiative from the Commission.
I consider it important, in the effort we are making to emphasise education, vocational training and lifelong learning in the context of the Lisbon strategy, to ensure that there is also feedback in response to that effort and concrete steps in the field of education in the European Union.
Comparable statistics will establish a viable system for collating statistical data on education and lifelong learning.
We will have available to us the most meaningful possible statistical information which will help us focus attention on shortcomings or misplaced objectives in implementing Community education policy.
in writing. - (SV) The June List accepts the Commission's proposals and the European Parliament's amendments, provided the EU institutions respect the principle that education policy is a national matter.
However, in Amendment 7 the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament proposes that a reference should also be included to the 'Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union'.
There is no such thing.
The EU Member States have not adopted any such charter.
There was a reference to such a document in the draft Constitutional Treaty, which was rejected through the democratic process in the summer of 2005.
On the other hand, all the EU Member States have signed the Council of Europe European Convention on Human Rights.
This means that all EU citizens can assert their fundamental freedoms and rights in the European Court of Human Rights.
The EU charter represents the opposite of the 'leaner but keener' EU which is often mentioned in solemn speeches about subsidiarity.
The EU should concentrate on cross-border matters, but stay away from matters on which the individual Member States can take their own decisions or which are already regulated in other international treaties.
It follows that the proposal for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights should be rejected, of course along with the 'new' Treaty for the EU.
in writing. - (DE) The statistics prove what we all know: a good education promises a higher income and protection against unemployment.
In this respect it is irresponsible of the EU constantly to allow in a vast number of unskilled migrants, who are then condemned to a life of unemployment and switch to moonlighting, as a result of which the low-wage sector comes under even greater pressure, who turn to crime or 'just' put pressure on the welfare state.
And if there really is a shortage of skilled workers, we should be training our own people instead of enticing cheap replacements from abroad with Green or Blue Cards, pushing wages down.
On this note it is important to have statistical data in order to be able to respond to undesirable trends.
(DE) Mr President, I abstained from voting on the Jarzembowski report since high-speed routes in Europe have been extended in recent years, mainly between major cities, and shorter routes have been most appallingly neglected, despite the fact that 90% of journeys are made on shorter routes.
On the one hand, Brussels is demanding that people become more mobile, and is wanting to shift traffic from road to rail, but on the other hand it is trying to bring into play precisely the opposite development with the magic formula of privatisation.
The EU needs to ensure that common standards and systems facilitate cross-border rail travel and important projects are promoted within the arterial roads.
In the end, however, it must understand that private investors do not have the welfare of the country and its people in mind, but ultimately only their profits and returns on their investment.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Georg Jarzembowski, partly because I hope that our excellent rapporteur will listen to the pensioners in Rome who, when I was leaving for Strasbourg, and knowing that this report was to be voted on, said to me: 'But Mr Fatuzzo, you haven't given an explanation of your vote for such a long time!
We would like you to tell the European Parliament, even if when you speak everyone is leaving, thinking about their own affairs and chatting, we would like you to tell the President, who is listening to you carefully, that passes should finally be produced for free movement throughout Europe, for the pensioners who want to see Europe with their own eyes after having spent so many years working to build it.
in writing. - (PT) The conclusion of the process of negotiation between the EP and the Council on what is euphemistically called 'the development of the Community's railways' establishes the beginning of the liberalisation of international passenger services from 1 January 2010.
We would point out that in previous readings in the EP we tabled proposals for rejection of this European Commission initiative.
However, the majority of the EP voted in favour of speeding up the liberalisation (and privatisation) of rail passenger services and attempted to include national passenger services as from 2017.
That attempt was not, however, successful and did not obtain the majority required for adoption.
The liberalisation of rail transport is an attempt to hand over the (most profitable) lines to large private interests by privatising the operation of those lines (in particular by means of concessions), promoting the creation of monopolies at the expense of public funds.
Rail transport is a strategic sector for a country's development because of its important role in the movement of goods and in the mobility of workers and of the population in general, and it has enormous benefits for the environment and for social and territorial cohesion.
What is required is the promotion and development of public rail transport systems in the various countries, not their privatisation.
That is why we voted against it.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting for liberalisation of international transport as from 2010.
Two years after the law comes into force at the latest, the European Commission should examine the impact of the directive and discussion on opening it up further will then take place.
Competition will thus be allowed to a limited extent and national suppliers will not be at risk.
I am relieved that the European Parliament has argued against the automatic liberalisation of national rail transport in 2017.
in writing. - (PL) I am voting in favour of Georg Jarzembowski's report on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community's railways and Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure.
The Third Railway Package constitutes a very important element of the regulations on transport.
International passenger transport networks need to be opened up, and the European Commission should analyse the situation in the international passenger transport market with a view to taking a decision on further liberalisation which also covers national transport.
in writing. - (SV) I welcome the possibility of cross-border train traffic, but for a market to function properly competition must be on equal terms.
It is therefore unfortunate that the EU is forcing through legislation under which countries that have not yet deregulated railway transport are to be given the right to compete with operators on a deregulated market where international train services are concerned.
In practice this proposal gives state-aided railway companies the possibility of competing on a market where there is free competition, which in the long term poses the risk of deactivating market mechanisms.
I have therefore chosen to vote against this report.
State-aided railway companies should not be allowed to compete on a market with free competition.
in writing. - (PT) The proposal for a directive on the ' forms part of the 'Third Railway Package', which aims principally to promote the liberalisation of international rail passenger services.
Here too, it should above all be stressed that the first objective of this directive will be, through harmonisation, to remove any obstacles to the liberalisation of international rail passenger services which might derive from different rules on professional requirements in the sector within each country.
The measure will also favour worker mobility in the sector.
In addition to the important set of questions which such a directive poses, it must be stressed that the adoption of harmonised rules at Community level on the certification of workers in the rail sector of each country must never jeopardise more progressive rights or standards already established at the level of each Member State, or deny the prerogative of each Member State to establish those rights and standards.
Here, too, reality shows that it is the liberalisation and privatisation of rail services which has jeopardised workers' rights and reduced the number of workers in the rail sector, with serious consequences for the level of service provided.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting for a standard driving licence for train drivers.
The harmonisation of training for drivers will also ensure greater safety in future on the railways.
A minimum age of 20 and an appropriate school education and language training are now compulsory as conditions for being allowed to work as a train driver in international rail transport.
The standardisation of training is key to a European rail network.
The driving licence issued in a Member State will be recognised in future by all the other Member States.
in writing. - (PT) The 'Third Railway Package', which aims principally to promote the liberalisation of international rail passenger services, contains a regulation on 'rail passengers' rights and obligations'.
Above all, we can state that the essential aim of this regulation is to remove any obstacles to the liberalisation of international rail passenger services which might derive from different rules on passengers' rights and obligations in the various countries.
In addition to stressing this first point - which is the central issue - we certainly consider that it is essential to safeguard passengers' rights, starting with the right to a public rail transport service provided by public undertakings in each country.
Reality shows that it is the liberalisation and privatisation of rail services that jeopardise passengers' rights: they have led to a deterioration in the services offered to the public and in the conditions for passenger mobility as well as an increase in fares; they have meant the loss of hundreds of kilometres of track, station closures, a reduction in the number of workers in the rail sector and a threat to their pay and to labour rights.
This is a disastrous policy opposed by workers and the public.
in writing. - I supported this report on the conciliation agreement on regulation of the rights and obligations of rail passengers.
This was originally intended to apply only to passengers on international journeys, and I am pleased that our views have been heeded, and that the rules will now include passengers on domestic journeys too.
From 2009, a reasonable set of basic rights will apply, including the right to accessible transport for people with reduced mobility.
In addition, I welcome the fact that a scheme of compensation in the event of delays will be introduced.
in writing. - (DE) I am voting for a new passenger regulation as from 2009.
Among other things, the regulation governs compensation for major delays, companies' liability for passengers and their luggage, transport of disabled people and the information to be supplied by the rail companies.
In practical terms this means that, in the future, when there is a delay in cross-border transport of between 60 and 119 minutes, customers will be entitled to a refund of 25 % of the fare.
This rises to 50% for delays of more than two hours.
This does means more legal claims, but also greater certainty for rail customers.
It is now also up to the Member States to extend these rules to their national transport networks as soon as possible and not just after 15 years.
in writing. - This report on rail passengers' rights and obligations should be welcomed.
in writing. - (SV) Although the latest proposal does not impose such stringent requirements on train operators as previous ones, it still contains much too extensive provisions on everything from how tickets can be purchased (by telephone, on the internet and from ticket machines) to the liability of train operators for damage to passengers' luggage.
There is also detailed regulation of various forms of compensation in the event of delays (compensation levels, entitlement to meals etc.) and minimum requirements for information on what may be the cause of any delays.
I chose to vote against the proposal because the operators must be allowed to develop their own services on the basis of the protection which passengers themselves demand (and are prepared to pay for in the form of higher fares).
Furthermore the wide-ranging regulations are not proportionate to the value added which will be created by the replacement of regulations that already exist at Member State level in those countries which have opted for national legislation.
in writing. - (DE) Liberalisation of railways is not an end in itself; it must serve users and improve efficiency.
Liberalisation in international transport is a natural thing because no one country should be able to close itself off from another.
In national transport there can be no sense and no purpose in exposing the profitable lines to competition during liberalisation, whilst at the same time leaving the unprofitable lines to the public sector, with no compensation.
With this in mind, I am anxiously awaiting the application of the recently adopted regulation on public passenger transport.
Parliament was able to stand up to the Member States and the rail companies for the rights of passengers, which is a huge success for the citizens of the EU.
Particularly in transit countries like Belgium, a difference between international and national passengers would make no sense and would be unfair.
In this sense, the third railways package represents a step in the right direction, even though it will certainly not be the last.
in writing. - I will be voting for the compromise agreed by our rapporteurs with the Council of Ministers because I believe it is a step forward for the railway industry throughout the European Union, and is the best deal available to Parliament at this time.
However, the slow pace with which the railway industry works is not only frustrating but also acts as a very effective brake on the kind of radical action that is required to galvanise railways in many of our Member States.
A wide gulf exists between the railways of say France and Germany with those of Bulgaria and Romania.
This gap needs to be closed if we are to be serious about developing a railway system that is clearly Europe-wide.
Finally, whilst I welcome the agreement that all railways should be fully accessible within 15 years, is it not a sad fact and an indictment on our railway industry that many people of reduced mobility do not have access to their railway in the 21st century?
The railway industry is caught in a philosophy of 'can't do' rather than one of 'can do'.
I hope this package of measures at least moves us away from negativity and starts a more positive era for our railways.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163)
(PL) We have given our opinion on changes to the previous reform of the EU sugar market.
This reform was drawn up in 2005 and was supposed to restore equilibrium in this market.
Sadly I have the impression that all these proposals are considerably restricting sugar beet growing in order to carve out a place for cane sugar.
I am fundamentally opposed to this.
We cannot allow traditional sugar beet growing and sugar production in the European Union to be eliminated.
I think that the new proposal put forward by the European Commission in May 2007, which is intended to provide incentives for the withdrawal of almost 3.8 million tonnes of sugar from the EU market, will again fail to bring about the anticipated results.
If it comes to the threatened mandatory reduction in quotas in 2010, quota cuts cannot take into account changes in the size of quotas given up previously, voluntarily and for payment, to the restructuring fund, since in line with the aim of the reform, restrictions on production took place in less competitive regions, following receipt of appropriate financial compensation.
(CS) Mr President, unfortunately the proposed sugar reform has no positive outcome.
This is due to the fact that, although the sugar reform seems to be based on economic factors, when the interested parties consider leaving the market they tend to take other factors into account.
Although the Czech Republic produces sugar on a profitable basis, we still renounced 22% of the quota: this quota is in the hands of Western Europe.
Unfortunately, the measures proposed may have a negative impact on the Czech Republic.
The same factors that make sugar production in our country profitable and give us the edge, such as the fact that the holdings of individual sugar beet growers are higher on average, may, in the light of these proposals, become a disadvantage if the farmers have the right to leave the market.
A situation whereby those who need no subsidies to survive are leaving the market is hardly desirable.
In this regard, the reform is moving in the wrong direction.
That is why I voted against both reports by the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when the vote was held today I voted, together with my colleagues in the Czech Civic Democratic Party, against the reports by the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, on the reform of the sugar regime.
So far this reform has damaged the Czech Republic: many sugar factories have closed and machinery and technology have lost their value.
For many centuries my country had a tradition of sugar production and export. Now, because of a poor European Union policy, we have become a net sugar importer; that is the result of incompetent decision-making in Brussels.
The Czech Republic has already decreased its sugar production by more than 20%. Other Member States of the European Union should do the same now, particularly the states that have not yet decreased their production at all.
These are the reasons why I voted against the reform.
(LT) Ladies and gentlemen, the restructuring of the sugar industry and the changes in the organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are necessary.
However, it is possible that the Commission's proposal will not solve problems but create even more in some countries' sugar market.
If a country is not able to set the priority order of criteria for the acceptance of growers' applications itself, taking into account farm productivity and the amount of production, it is possible that not only farms with the lowest productivity but also the competitive growers will stop producing sugar beet.
In Lithuania's situation, sugar factories may face a shortage of raw sugar and this would have negative economic and social consequences.
Moreover, the Commission has not considered Lithuania's proposal to reduce the quota until 2010, taking into account not only whether a Member State voluntarily reduces its production quota, but also whether it has bought a supplementary production quota.
I would encourage the Commission to take account of the remarks made.
Incidentally, I abstained in the vote on this project.
in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted against Parliament's report on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector.
Basically we are favourably disposed to a reform of the Community sugar sector.
However, we do not think that Parliament's proposed amendments add anything positive to the Commission proposal.
We think that they pose the risk of cost increases in a sector of agriculture which is already far too large, something that we Swedish Social Democrats can never support.
In addition, we think that export subsidies for sugar must be completely removed in the long term.
Subsidies which continue to be paid to agriculture should be given in the form of direct aid entirely decoupled from production.
As part of the reform of the common market organisation for sugar, the European Union wanted to help refineries adapt to the restructuring of the European sugar industry by granting EUR 150 million in 'transitional aid'.
I was delighted with this initiative, which among other things should help the Saint-Louis Sucre refinery in Marseille meet the new conditions on the sugar market without resorting to job cuts.
However, I also alerted the competent French and European authorities to the lack of transparency in the criteria for allocating this aid, which is the responsibility of the Member States.
Currently, this aid is not granted with the intention of maintaining the refining industry or preserving jobs.
Neither is there any guarantee that this aid will not be used as an 'incentive to relocate' to countries outside the EU.
The new reform should have been an opportunity to clarify this point.
Regrettably, this has not been the case.
The matter is now in the hands of the Council.
I am calling for greater vigilance from the Council, particularly of the French authorities, so that this issue, which affects the jobs of our fellow citizens can finally be clarified.
in writing. - (SV) The June List supports a radical reform of the sugar markets in the EU with a view to liberalising them as quickly as possible and giving sugar-producing countries outside the EU the chance to compete on fair terms.
The amendments proposed by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs in this report are nothing more than a further attempt to impede the rate of reform as much as possible so that a protectionist trade policy can continue.
The amendments would also mean an increase in the cost of the industrial restructuring of existing refineries which the reform would involve, at the same time as more generous direct compensation to players on the sugar market.
The June List can never give its backing to a report which frustrates the purposes of reforms to the sugar market in the EU and which would inevitably dilute those reforms as well as jeopardise their completion.
We oppose blatant attempts to renege on commitments which have been made to less developed countries.
For the above-mentioned reasons, therefore, we vote against this report.
in writing. - (PT) Reality has shown that in this as in other sectors, persuading small growers to renounce quotas and abandon production - as proposed for sugar beet and sugar production - with a view to promoting competition, has adverse effects; it accentuates development inequalities and will increase poverty and the exodus from the countryside.
We therefore object to the European Commission's proposals and stress the need to reverse this policy and take account of the specific reality of the Member States and their production needs.
We therefore support food sovereignty and hence consider it unacceptable that a country such as Portugal, with only very limited sugar production, scarcely able to supply half the country's consumption need should be confronted with the obligation to reduce its quota for sugar produced from sugar beet.
We consider it essential for the liberalising trend seen in successive CAP reforms to be reversed and measures to be taken to maintain national sugar beet production, supporting agriculture that is essentially focused upon food production and thus helping to safeguard the two factories' production as well as employment.
in writing. - (CS) The European Union is often justifiably criticised for interfering in a range of industrial sectors.
Particularly controversial is its interference in the affairs of the food processing industry.
It is true that some Member States create their own problems.
A classical example is the strenuous effort by a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe to liquidate cooperative farms even though they are prosperous.
In the Czech Republic several amended laws governing cooperative farming have been trying to achieve exactly this.
Many cooperative farms have fallen apart and others have transformed into different legal entities.
At the same time production has decreased in a range of industries, for example in the sugar beet growing industry.
Furthermore, processing has unfortunately become detached from production as a result of privatisation. Most sugar factories have been acquired by foreign parties.
This has resulted led to a disastrous situation in the sugar industry in the Czech Republic: the profits end up in the pockets of the foreigners while the losses hit the people of the Czech Republic.
There has been more than a 20% decrease in sugar production in a country that had been exporting sugar for 150 years.
Now the country must begin to import sugar and at the same time look for new opportunities for the farms that have been growing sugar beet until now.
This untenable situation is not solved by Mrs Katerina Batzeli's reports; however, we voted in favour of them because they at least draw attention to the unsatisfactory situation.
I would add a word of warning to those who see today's texts as a solution to the problem.
I trust that we will return to the sugar issue and that the next time we will be able to respond more successfully to our farmers' needs.
in writing. - I support the report on reform of the sugar sector, although there are some areas of concern with this report.
I do not agree with the report in its intent to apply the process of withdrawal of sugar surplus to cane refiners.
This is in contrast to the Commission proposal to exclude cane refining from the withdrawal process.
As the refiners are not directly part of the restructuring scheme, to reduce by withdrawal the refiners' traditional supply needs (TSNs) would have no effect on reducing the surplus of sugar on the EU market, because the EU would still have to meet its international obligation to import specified quantities of raw sugar from ACP countries.
The amendment would, however, tend to weaken the impact of the measure in providing incentives to beet processors to dismantle their plant.
in writing. - I shall be voting in favour of the report that has been prepared by Ms Batzeli, because it is quite obvious that a restructuring of the sugar industry is required.
My only concern relates to Amendment 31, which, if passed, would still commit the European Commission to keeping the existing fund open up to 2011, and would be a negative aspect of this restructuring process.
This report, whilst not perfect, nevertheless strikes a balance between the needs of the producers and the obvious need to reform this sector.
My only concern regards the effect any restructuring could have on sugar cane producers from developing countries.
At all costs we must avoid a restructuring that protects beet producers at the expense of cane producers and I would hope that the Commission will ensure that this does not happen, whilst still being fair to our own farmers.
in writing. - When voting on agriculture reports such as this report on sugar, Members with a financial interest should declare it or decline from voting.
We should support the EU's commitment to achieving the ambitious goal of generating 20% of total energy consumed in Europe from renewable sources by 2020.
Renewable energy offers numerous advantages for Europe: lower CO2 emissions, reduced European dependency and a contribution to job creation and growth.
However, we need to monitor the development of all renewable energy from the point of view of sustainability, depending of course on the capacities of the Member States, as well as saving energy through lower consumption and increased energy efficiency.
I regret that the Directive on electricity from renewable energy sources does not make cogeneration compulsory and will lead to the building of large-scale biomass power stations without cogeneration, which are not energy efficient and destabilise the market in timber for both industrial and energy generation purposes.
There are examples of this in my own region, Limousin.
I am pleased therefore that the European Parliament is asking for a proposal on the heating and cooling sectors to be central to the future Framework Directive on renewable energies and I therefore voted in favour of the Thomsen Report.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Thomsen report on the Roadmap for Renewable Energy in Europe, since I believe that increasing investment in renewable energy is essential to reduce the European Union's external energy dependence, cut CO2 emissions, and therefore help to combat climate change.
This report underscores the importance of the sustainable use of biofuels in the transport sector in order to reduce oil dependency and greenhouse gas emissions, thus lessening the environmental impact.
in writing. - (PT) This is a very unbalanced report, despite some positive changes compared with previous reports, in particular in that it admits that fossil energy sources will inevitably run out in the near future - although it makes no mention of high oil prices - and in that it recognises the environmental and social harm associated with the recently deified agrofuels.
However, it then forgets the need for a different set of energy policy priorities geared towards reducing costs for consumers, rationalising consumption in order to reduce it (and not merely through energy efficiency), less polluting public transport and a public policy that is genuinely in the peoples' interest.
The idea of setting up a Common European Energy Policy is an attempt to find ways of providing greater support for the sector's private financial groups, overriding the sovereign right of every Member State to set its own energy policies.
It also omits to analyse gaseous biofuels; it fails to stress the need to encourage research into and development of biogas and does not mention the Target 2020 Programme.
That is because the main objective of the report is to guarantee ever greater profits, specifically by using the market in greenhouse gas emissions trading.
I voted in favour of this report, which encourages Member States to take the necessary measures to increase the share of renewables in their energy mix.
Renewables must become the 'stepping stone' to reaching the dual objective of increased security of supply and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
The energy efficiency objective should not be seen as a precondition for achieving the 20% renewables target by 2020, but as a condition in its own right.
This will create new jobs and encourage research and innovation in the energy sector.
I am thinking for example of research into increasing access to environmentally-friendly housebuilding materials.
Renewable energy is one of the best ways of protecting consumers and industry from the dual effects of increased energy imports and rising fuel costs.
Finally, I am pleased about freedom to choose the most appropriate renewable energy sources given that the potential to develop certain renewable energies varies because of the particular geological, hydrological and climatic conditions in each Member State.
in writing. - I supported the Thomsen report and strongly believe that more effort should be directed towards the promotion of renewable energy.
My own country, Scotland, has immense potential in the field of renewable energy and the Scottish government has recently signalled its intention to promote as diverse a range of renewable technologies as possible.
I believe that Scotland's efforts have a vital role to play in the EU's targets for renewable technology.
I voted against setting a 10% target for plant fuels, and in favour of calls for a full impact assessment before considering any possible biofuels target.
Biofuel production can accelerate global warming by speeding up the destruction of forests, peatlands, healthy soils and other ecosystems which are carbon sinks and which help to regulate the climate.
in writing. - (CS) I adore amateur performances.
It does not matter much what subject the amateur covers, with his ideological blinders on: the result is always the same.
A black and white description of reality; ecstatic conclusions divorced from the world of facts.
In addition, in the course of practical application sometimes there are high costs and 'unexpected problems'.
Especially charming are the speeches by some of my fellow Members on such attractive topics as biomass and biofuels, which consume high levels of energy during the transportation of raw materials, processing and product distribution: as experience shows, this is a basic fact.
In order to reduce costs we should build small production units supplying local neighbourhoods with alternative fuels.
I must stress that these sources cannot provide the solution to our power supply situation.
They only offer a relatively slight improvement on the current situation.
The same is true of the rainwater harvesting systems that are becoming very popular and a number of other renewable energy resources.
In the next 10 years large cities and industry will depend on large-scale energy production and on natural gas.
If we want to meet the Kyoto Protocol commitments, the countries with a rapidly growing gross domestic product will also have to build large power plants.
This can mean only one thing: more nuclear power plants.
Otherwise the European Union will soon become highly dependent on energy imports.
The daydreams of romantic amateurs will not change this fact.
in writing. - (IT) I supported the Thomsen report, which confirms the need to obtain 20% of energy from renewable energy sources by 2020.
This will be a major challenge for every European country, and we must no longer seek to evade the challenge or require only the most virtuous and far-seeing Member States to meet it.
I think differentiated national objectives need to be set, allocated fairly with regard to the existing levels of renewable energies, the energy mix and the differing development potentials that result from varied climate, geological and territorial conditions in the Member States.
Renewable sources represent the future.
Investment in innovation and technology will need to be huge in order to allow Europe to resolve the problem of energy dependency within a reasonable time-frame, guaranteeing affordable prices for users.
I believe, however, that we ought to be pragmatic, and avoid succumbing to hypocrisy.
Imagining that the production of renewable energy will by itself allow us to meet such ambitious targets is unrealistic, although the preconceptions and often ideological ideas of certain left-wing and Green politicians may convince us otherwise.
What can save Europe in the medium term is an energy mix which also includes energy sources that are not wholly renewable, such as nuclear power, which, like it or not, accounts for one third of Europe's electricity production.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (NL) In view of the fact that our party, the Dutch Socialist Party, attaches great importance to renewable energy sources and feels that action must be taken on a much wider scale in this respect, we have not voted against this report.
However, it contains a few very negative issues.
We strongly reject nuclear energy as a sustainable, renewable source of energy.
In addition, we are opposed to the idea that energy markets must be liberalised at European level.
Finally, we are of the opinion that solar energy, wind energy and water energy are better alternatives to biofuels.
in writing. - (EL) The Commission's proposal to set a production target of 20% of total energy from renewable sources, which must be achieved by each Member State and must be included in national action plans, would have been acceptable were it aiming to meet people's needs, reduce energy dependency, save energy, protect the environment and confirm that energy products are a public asset and not a commodity.
The EU guidelines, however, are aimed at profitability for investors and using renewable energy to pave the way for private capital, while guaranteeing the profitability of renewable energy.
Although renewable sources of energy are natural and inexhaustible, and they contribute to reducing the use of pollutants, the environment continues to be ruined in the name of profit.
An example is the uncontrolled promotion of wind farms for private profit, even in areas protected by NATURA.
As a result, the environment is a hypocritical pretext concealing the liberalisation of the energy sector and its effects on the people's interests.
Energy is being dealt with as a commodity rather than as a common asset.
As for biofuels, it is a provocation to use food products for energy and not to feed the hungry when millions of people are starving to death.
in writing. - (DE) Even though the promotion of renewable energy is important, this should not be a pretext in relation to the EU Constitution for reducing even further the sovereign rights of Member States by the back door.
Since this point has unfortunately not found its way into the present report, and no clarification has been made, I must therefore reject the present report.
Concentration on expensive nuclear power plants has obstructed the development of other energy technologies for far too long.
The nuclear research budget is still seven to eight times higher compared with funds for renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.
If the EU really is serious about renewable energy sources with its roadmap, it must provide a fairer distribution of subsidies here, but there is no indication of this in the report on which we are voting either.
in writing. - (PT) Increasing consumption is a sign of a generalised (if not always balanced) improvement in living conditions.
Measures aimed at combating the negative effects of increasing consumption should therefore bear in mind that one of the factors in the equation - that growth cannot be altered.
That then leaves the possibility of acting on two fronts: rationalising of consumption and improving the efficiency (particularly energy efficiency) of what we produce.
That means that much of what we need to try to achieve depends upon research and innovation.
The approved resolution quite rightly stresses that 'renewable sources of energy are a key element in a sustainable energy mix, contributing to: reduced import dependency and diversification of the fuel mix; lower CO2 and other emissions; the development of new innovative technologies; and employment and regional development opportunities'; one of the conclusion's drawn is that greater use should be made of the EU's research and technology programmes to encourage the development of renewable energy technologies.
To sum up: I agree with the approach taken and am in favour of increasing investment to this end.
That is the main reason why I voted in favour of the report.
We fully support the promotion of renewable energy, whether for transport, heating or electricity generation.
Like all our fellow Members, we see it as a way of protecting the environment, but also of reducing our energy dependence.
However, we cannot support Mrs Thomsen's report.
First of all, her real aim is not ecological or even economic, it is dogmatic: as indicated in the explanatory statement, the aim is to introduce a common European energy policy, and this must take precedence over everything else.
However, energy policy, a matter of sovereignty and independence, should fall solely under national competence.
In no way does this prevent cooperation and solidarity.
In addition, the proposals in the report do not seem sufficient to guarantee that national circumstances will be properly taken into account: not only geographical characteristics, but also specific economic constraints.
The text is also silent on the ways of helping countries that are least advanced in this area to achieve a binding, universal target.
I say yes to renewables, but not as a pretext for extending the powers of the European Union.
in writing. - Renewable energy in Europe is an important issue, which, in my mind, does not get the recognition it fully deserves.
In this era of energy crisis, global warming and diminishing stocks of the most traditional fossil fuels, it is right that Parliament should examine a better use of renewable energy.
However, I would also like to point out that we still have large reserves of coal throughout the EU and, with the development of clean coal technology, I pose the question whether or not our abandonment of coal, as a source of energy, was premature?
I will support this report, but I think we must be realistic in what can be achieved with wind or wave energy, especially when matched up with the ever-increasing energy demands of the EU.
I think it is right to ask the Commission to draw up action plans involving renewable energy including wind, wave and solar power generation, as well as developing a strategy for biofuels.
Although in regard to this, we must ensure that we do not save the planet, environmentally, only to see its population starve to death, which is why the committee's call for a fair balance between food and energy production is a correct stance to take.
in writing. - In my country, Ireland, residential energy accounted for about 25 % of the total final energy consumption.
A large proportion of this energy accounted for was connected to the consumption of energy for heat.
Energy consumption in the domestic sector is greater than necessary, as people living in inefficient dwellings must consume more energy to heat their homes.
Improving a household's energy efficiency status can often be achieved by taking some relatively simple and inexpensive steps, such as fitting thermostatic valves onto radiators or using more energy efficient household appliances.
Other measures include installation of full central heating systems, or the provision of insulation in cavity walls or lofts.
These latter options can be more disruptive in the short term, but their impact is long lasting.
I would like to call on governments to promote insulation in housing and the other measures that I have mentioned.
In promoting these measures one can save in energy costs whilst helping the environment.
The VAT reduction on renovation should be promoted by governments.
Better insulation would cut the residential energy consumption down by up to 5 %.
in writing. - I can vote for this report and believe that its overall objectives are balanced against the back-drop of continued concern over energy security.
Renewables are an important aspect of our future electricity generation but still we need to work with existing energy production.
If the EU can put its emphasis on the technology necessary to take it into the 21st century, it will also enjoy a competitive edge in this sector in the years to come.
in writing. - (NL) The report on the roadmap for renewable energy is a clever piece of work.
It clearly states that the coming years are crucial and that a legislative framework is needed to support the codecision procedure in order to raise the current share of 7% renewable energy in the energy mix to 20% in 2020.
The report rightly emphasises the enormous potential of offshore wind energy: a possible contribution of 15% of the total EU energy demand by 2020, which could lead to the creation of 368 000 jobs.
The necessary question marks have rightly been placed alongside the development of biofuels, certainly in relation to the necessity for sustainable production methods and the reasonable balance between food and energy production.
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance would have put it somewhat more sharply and therefore request that a serious analysis be carried out into the effects of biofuels on the climate, the environment, the social structure and a secure food supply.
It is unfortunate that in the report, the target for biofuels remains unchanged at 10%.
Another minus point in the report is Recital E, in which the nuclear lobby proposes nuclear energy as a 'bridge' technology.
The Greens disagree with this and therefore submitted Amendment 2.
Overall, this is a thorough report that merits our support.

Implementation of the Council decision on the moratorium against death penalty (debate)
The next item is the Council statement on the implementation of the Council decision on the moratorium against the death penalty.
Madam President, I am very pleased to be here today speaking on an issue that is central to our common European values.
Opposition to the death penalty is an integral part of the EU's human rights policy and was the subject of the first EU human rights guidelines.
Those guidelines, as you well know, ladies and gentlemen, have since 1998 set out the main aspects of the EU approach to that question, thus crystallising our well-known opposition to the death penalty.
We might recall the Union's objectives on the death penalty, as enshrined in the guidelines.
The first objective is to work towards universal abolition of the death penalty as the policy view agreed and strongly held by all EU Member States.
The second objective is, for countries where the death penalty still exists, to call for its use to be progressively restricted and to insist that it be carried out according to minimum international standards.
I am very pleased to be in this Chamber today to tell you of the latest developments in our fight to abolish the death penalty.
As you know, we recently launched an important initiative to promote these EU objectives.
I am, of course, referring to the Council's decision of 18 June this year in which the European Union committed itself to introducing a resolution against the death penalty at the 62nd UN General Assembly as part of a cross-regional alliance.
Parliament called for the European Union to take such an initiative in two resolutions adopted this year in February and in April.
Since the opening of the third session of the United Nations General Assembly is rapidly approaching, I realise that you will want to know how the Council has been preparing for that event.
I shall tell you a little more in a few moments about the preparations we have in hand.
Before that, let me look back briefly over the period of almost 10 years since the guidelines on the death penalty were adopted.
I should stress that we have achieved a great deal since 1998.
We have developed a broad range of instruments in our campaign against the death penalty, from political action by means of demarches, declarations and multilateral diplomacy to financial support through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, an instrument created essentially thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament.
For example, between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007, the European Union made general demarches on the death penalty in 28 countries, from Bahrain to Zambia; we also made demarches on individual cases in various countries from Yemen to Iran; furthermore, there are frequent EU declarations on this subject.
To give you an example which received fairly wide media coverage: in August this year the European Union issued a declaration on the 400th execution in Texas.
I should also like to point out that the death penalty is also on the agenda of the human rights dialogues and consultations which we hold with third countries and we do not shy away from raising the question with any of them.
Our confidence in effective multilateralism also takes the form of tireless action against the death penalty within the United Nations and other international bodies.
Every year from 1997 to 2005, the European Union submitted a resolution on the death penalty to the UN Commission on Human Rights and, re-launching our action in December 2006, the EU submitted a statement on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly initially bearing 85 signatures and later signed by 10 more countries.
The Presidency of the European Union reiterated that December 2006 declaration at the opening of the fourth session of the Human Rights Council in March 2007.
Despite the continuing concern about the use of the death penalty, we are very pleased to note a global trend towards abolition or introducing a moratorium on the death penalty.
More than half the countries in the world have already abolished capital punishment either by law or in practice: 133 countries, according to Amnesty International.
I should like to believe that the European Union, including of course the European Parliament, has played a role, if only a modest one, in that trend towards abolition through our systematic and sustained action over the years.
This brief list of the European Union's actions against the death penalty is proof of our commitment to this cause and let me stress that we acknowledge that the European Parliament has been a loyal ally in our work, which brings me back to our current agenda item, that is, the resolution for the UN General Assembly calling for a moratorium and the abolition of the death penalty.
This initiative confirms that the European Union is at the forefront of abolitionist efforts throughout the world and that it will continue to oppose the death penalty in all cases and under any circumstances, since it considers it to be a cruel and inhuman punishment.
There is a lot to be gained with this initiative, but also a lot to lose if we are not successful.
We must not forget that this is our third attempt, I repeat, our third attempt to obtain a resolution on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly following our two failures in 1994 and 1999.
What is at stake is nothing more and nothing less than our credibility as leaders of the global efforts to abolish the death penalty.
That was why the Council considered it necessary to be well prepared and to have enough time to form a cross-regional alliance.
That would not have been possible at the time of the 61st General Assembly, as some of you would have preferred.
It was not only the Council's experts who were of that opinion.
Several NGOs which lead the fight in this field, such as the Coalition Against the Death Penalty, asked us not to be too hasty in submitting the resolution but to wait long enough to guarantee its success.
That was exactly the path we followed.
The Council decision of 18 June to introduce a resolution at the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly marked the beginning of a new phase in the multilateral sphere.
The Council, the Presidency and the Member States have each played their role to put the Council's decision into practice.
Even before the summer holiday the CFSP Working Party on Human Rights had decided on the approach to be taken - that is, for the EU Member States to agree on a draft text and, in a second phase, find other co-authors from various regions of the world; that was done, so that at the end of August there was a first meeting with all the co-authors in New York.
Within the space of two weeks agreement was reached on the wording.
We are now launching a lobbying campaign to have co-sponsors of our draft resolution.
As I speak, our embassies throughout the world are sounding out possible supporters of our initiative.
We are doing everything possible to win maximum support in order to make this resolution a success.
In that spirit, ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your confidence and support to enable us to carry out that process.
You will certainly be aware how difficult political negotiations can be.
You will therefore understand that the Presidency needs a certain degree of flexibility and room for manoeuvre to manage and find the appropriate timetable for an initiative of such complexity, because this is a cross-regional initiative and the co-authors must also review the text and the strategy of this resolution; moreover, we must quickly make contact with a large number of possible co-sponsors, so that the initiative gains weight.
We have embarked upon a campaign which is also a great challenge, but I am convinced that if we take concerted action we shall make this initiative a success.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (LT) Madam President, Commissioner, Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen, today here in the European Parliament we are returning to the issue of a moratorium on capital punishment.
We have already considered this issue twice over the last year, with two resolutions on the implementation of a global moratorium on capital punishment being adopted (on 1 February and 26 April).
We can only regret that in the case of each of these resolutions the European Parliament addressed the Council, encouraging it to submit the resolution to the General Assembly of the United Nations, but the Council has not yet done so.
The Council could do this before the start of the session of the 62nd General Assembly and it would be possible to adopt the resolutions before the end of this year.
Capital punishment is a cruel and inhuman kind of punishment infringing one of the inherent human rights - the right to life - and we really cannot tolerate a situation where thousands of people face capital punishment every year in Iran and China and other countries.
Therefore, the implementation of a global moratorium on capital punishment seeking to fully abolish it remains one of our most important political aims and we therefore require not only the consensus of our parliamentary groups on this issue, but also the consensus of all EU Member States.
I am sure that in adopting this resolution the European Parliament could show extraordinary solidarity and consensus, despite a difference of opinion, for example regarding the declaration of 10 February as the European Day against the Death Penalty.
The European Parliament has a golden opportunity to demonstrate cohesion and solidarity to the Council, especially when taking a decision on a political issue that has clear added value.
Politics without value is just cheap politicking and populism, while human life is valuable to us all, irrespective of geographical or cultural divides.
I truly encourage my fellow members in all groups to support this important resolution.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, State Secretary Lobo Antunes has convincingly demonstrated the Council's efforts here.
I have nothing to add to what the Minister has said.
Our Group supports you fully in your efforts to make it clear that the European Union wants to give strong backing not just to a moratorium, but to the aim of banning the death penalty throughout the world.
As the previous speaker has said, the European Parliament has already said twice this year: this Parliament is spearheading the battle to ban the death penalty.
For us as European Social Democrats, the death penalty is the lowest point in human ethics.
I come from a country in which human dignity is the first article of the constitution.
The duty of each and every government regulation is to preserve and protect it.
That is the message of my country's constitution.
On the basis of that message we in the European Union have drawn up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, the prime message of which is as above: human dignity is the foremost guiding principle of the European Union.
Simply put, the death penalty is the opposite of human dignity.
It is the vilification of the human being down to the lowest point of his or her existence.
The duty of each and every morally-driven democrat is to ban it.
We are fighting for this moratorium to be supported by the European Union.
Why, then, is there no consensus in the Council?
There is one Member State in the Council boycotting a joint resolution of the European Union.
I shall not hesitate in naming it publicly here.
It is the Polish government, which does not want us to make this fundamental decision.
It is linking the issue of the death penalty with other issues and saying: when the others link their opinion on this issue with that on abortion and euthanasia, then we too will be prepared to argue against the death penalty.
That is a pretextual argument!
Why?
I'll gladly tell you.
I should like to read a quotation to you, which comes from a radio interview of 28 July this year.
I quote: "I personally was, am and remain an advocate of the death penalty.
A return to this penalty is not possible at present, but I am counting on the fact that a more favourable climate will prevail in the EU in future.”
Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic of Poland.
That is the reason why there has been no European Council resolution to date on this moratorium.
The Polish President is an advocate of the death penalty and he hopes that there will be a better climate in the European Union for re-introducing it.
I therefore say: this Parliament is there to ensure that the climate in Europe remains against the death penalty.
That is the crucial point.
(Applause)
As long as we as European Socialists have influence, we shall do this.
I would ask the Council one question, however: Mr Lobo Antunes, not of you personally, but of the Heads of State and Government of the other 26 States.
How long will the other 26 Heads of State and Government put up with this and remain silent about the fact that an advocate of the death penalty, who states quite openly that he is so, is able to paralyse the European Council on this issue?
We need an answer to this, too.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the statements that the Presidency has been making to this Parliament for a year would seem - if we were a parliament such as the British parliament or the United States parliament, for instance - like an offence not only against the truth but also against Parliament.
No, President-in-Office of the Council, I think that you have been misinformed by the apparatus and structure which is behind you at the moment, and which since 1994 has been adopting an unworthy and incomprehensible approach, for which the six-monthly Presidencies that follow one another are responsible, or manage to make themselves responsible!
In 1994 we were on the verge of winning.
We lost by 8 votes, because 20 European countries which are now members of the European Union collaborated with each other and abstained.
The universal moratorium could have been proclaimed throughout the world, had it not been for that disgrace, which we should not dismiss: 20 European abstentions, in 1994, with a Council that was fully and hypocritically complicit.
You, President-in-Office of the Council, also had the impudence to say in 1999 - according to all the European ambassadors we had won because there was a very large absolute majority - on the morning of the vote, a telegram arrived from Brussels telling us to withdraw.
This was inexplicable!
In 2003 the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, then occupying the Council Presidency, declared that because of a lack of agreement by the European Union, Italy was not taking forward the resolution on which we again had a majority.
Now, the state of affairs is more shocking.
Do you understand, though, Mr Antunes?
In which country could we tell a tall story like this?
You say that 173 of 192 UN Member States have abolished the death penalty in fact and in law.
All this is your immense exertion!
You ought to have tabled a resolution in the 61st Assembly, the previous one, you ought to have tabled one at the beginning of this one, that is, yesterday, and already the news we have today from New York is of further postponements.
You also told another small or serious untruth: it is true that 95 countries have signed a declaration, and that on 28 December we, as the Italian Government, already had 85 signatories and what you have achieved we actually achieved together, namely only 11 more.
So if you want to lose, go ahead, but it is a shame, we will do...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, seeking humanitarianism in the administration of justice is one of Europe's important missions.
We need to stand up against public show executions in which the remains of the executed person become an unhealthy object of excitement for the crowds.
We must do everything we can to oppose executions carried out to political order from the authorities in China or Iran.
What we cannot agree to, however, is a narrow understanding of this whole problem.
In particular, we cannot agree to a termination of discussion on this subject.
We cannot agree to the kind of censorship proposed by Mr Schulz in his speech.
It is not up to him how long Lech Kaczyński remains President of Poland, no matter how much he wishes it were.
It depends on the Poles, who have their own doubts.
And it is not just the Poles who have doubts about the global moratorium, or about the propaganda and social campaigns proposed by the Commission.
I have one question - is it in fact possible, from a comfortable government seat in Paris or Lisbon, to dispatch an appeal for the suspension of capital punishment to regions that are rife with cruelty and violence?
Is it not hypocrisy to expect capital punishment to be abolished today in Iraq or Afghanistan while doing nothing to restore security and justice in these countries?
I do not share the conviction that abolition of capital punishment in other parts of the world will provide a solution to violence and brutality.
Anyway, Poland abolished the death penalty in 1988, nearly twenty years ago now.
We did this in the face of our own public opinion.
We did it in the name of European unity.
We want to continue supporting that decision today.
It may be that in fact our part of the world can permit itself alternatives to capital punishment.
We wish to show solidarity by cooperating on this matter, in the UN forum too, but we cannot agree to European censorship on the death penalty as proposed by Mr Schulz.
The draft resolution makes unnecessary reference to the issue of the European Day against the Death Penalty.
May I remind you that the death penalty is not the only place where we run up against matters of life and death in politics and law.
If we are to conduct a dialogue in Europe on contemporary challenges to humanitarianism, we cannot restrict ourselves to the death penalty, on which we do, after all, have a common opinion.
We cannot avoid discussing abortion on request, which is also so keenly defended in Europe and around the world by this Parliament and Mr Schulz's club.
We cannot avoid discussing euthanasia, guarantees for human dignity, or the burgeoning development of biomedical science.
If one of the days on the European calendar is to be a day for reflection on the humanitarian aspect of the legislator's work, and also ours, we cannot just shut our eyes to all of this, or we shall descend into hypocrisy.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to continue along the lines already set out by Mr Pannella and I would ask the Presidency to give a reply, if possible.
I would like to know why the Presidency has withdrawn the request or the proposal to establish a European Day on the death penalty.
It is not written anywhere that this is a decision that must be taken unanimously.
If you can quote me a rule where this is stipulated, I would be grateful - although since we are talking about political cooperation, I am fully convinced that if you had wanted to, you would have been able to force a vote and obtain an overwhelming majority, minus one.
I believe that that would have been a great day for Europe.
Thus, an opportunity has been wasted.
Secondly, I too am very confused, Mr Antunes, about your reconstruction of the sad history of the various tablings and withdrawals of resolutions for a moratorium.
I would like you to answer a specific question: since you, as the Portuguese Presidency, have decided to act practically alone, excluding other countries such as my own from the United Nations negotiations - but that is not an issue for this forum - I would like to know when you are tabling the resolution.
This too is unclear, and if you table it too late it will be utterly useless.
Thirdly, you said two things that worried me slightly.
